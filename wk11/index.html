<h3>Lesson 17: Performing Incident Response</h3>
<b>01) A user calls the help desk to report that Microsoft Excel continues to crash when used. The technician would like to review the logs in an attempt to determine the cause. 
        Analyze the types of logs to determine which would contain the information the technician needs.</b>
    <i>Event Log -  An event log records events that occur within an operating system or a software application. These logs diagnose errors and performance problems.</i>

<b>02) A system compromise prompts the IT department to harden all systems. The technicians look to block communications to potential command and control servers. Which solutions apply to working with egress filtering? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>- Restrict DNS lookup
       - Allow only authorized application ports
       A recommended filtering approach would be to restrict DNS lookups to an ISP's DNS services or authorized public resolvers, such as Google's, helps to prevent lookups of malicious hosts.

       A recommended filtering approach would be to allow only authorized application ports and, if possible, restricting the destination addresses to authorized Internet hosts helps to avoid contact with malicious servers.</i>

<b>03) Successful adversarial attacks mostly depend on knowledge of the algorithms used by the target AI. In an attempt to keep an algorithm secret, which method does an engineer use when hiding the secret?</b>
    <i>Obscurity - Algorithm secrecy is secrecy by obscurity (hiding). This approach can partially mitigate risks from less motivated threat actors, who will simply move to the next, easier target. </i>

<b>04) An engineer creates a set of tasks that queries information and runs some PowerShell commands to automate several stages of the process, including the identification of threats and other malicious activity on multiple servers. 
       The engineer defines these tasks using which of the following?</b>
    <i>Runbook -  A runbook aims to automate as many stages of the playbook as possible, while leaving clearly defined interaction points for human analysis.</i>
    
<b>05) A security team desires to modify event logging for several network devices to work over TCP and use secure connections. What uses more types of filter expressions in its configuration file to customize message handling?</b>
    <i>Rsyslog -  Rsyslog can work over TCP and use a secure connection. It uses the same configuration file syntax as Syslog. Rsyslog can use more types of filter expressions in its configuration file to customize message handling.</i>
    
<b>06) The first responder to a security incident decides the issue requires escalation. Consider the following and select the scenario that best describes escalation in this issue.</b>
    <i>The first responder calls senior staff to get them involved. -Escalation is the process of involving additional senior staff to assist in incident management when the first responder feels the situation is too complex to manage alone.  </i>
    
<b>07) During weekly scans, a system administrator identifies a system that has software installed that goes against security policy. The system administrator removes the system from the network in an attempt to limit the effect of the
       incident on the remainder of the network. Apply the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide principles to determine which stage of the incident response life cycle the administrator has entered.</b>
    <i>Containment, Eradication, and Recovery - The system administrator has entered the containment, eradication, and recovery stage by removing the system from the network. This action contains the incident and protects the other network resources. 
        This is also the stage where the administrator will repair the system and bring it back online or replace it. </i>
    
<b>08) A security analyst needs to contain a compromised system with the quickest approach that requires no configuration. Which solution does the analyst utilize?</b>
    <i>Air Gap - A simple option is to disconnect the host from the network completely (creating an air gap) or disabling its switch port. This is the least stealthy option and may reduce opportunities to analyze the attack or malware due to the isolation.</i>

<b>09) A systems administrator suspects that a virus has infected a critical server. In which step of the incident response process does the administrator notify stakeholders of the issue?</b>
    <i>Identification - In the identification phase, it is important to determine whether an incident has taken place, assess how severe it might be (triage), and notify stakeholders. </i>
    
<b>10) The IT team at a company discovers that a Windows server is infected with malware. As a result, the server is not functioning properly. Which event log does the team review to find errors from failing services related to newly installed software?</b>
    <i>Application -  On a Windows system, the application event logs record events generated by applications and services, such as when a service run by a third-party application cannot start.</i>
    
<b>11) An engineer needs to review systems metadata to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. The first step the engineer takes in the investigation is to review MTA information in an Internet header. Which data type does the engineer review?</b>
    <i>Email -  An email's Internet header contains address information for the recipient and sender, plus details of the servers or message Transfer Agents (MTA) handling transmission of the message between them.</i>
    
<b>12) An administrator uses data from a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to identify potential malicious activity. Which feature does the administrator utilize when implementing rules to interpret relationships between datapoints to diagnose incidents?</b>
    <i>Correlation - Correlation means interpreting the relationship between individual data points to diagnose incidents of significance to the security team. A SIEM correlation rule is a statement that matches certain conditions. </i>
    
<b>13) Incident management relies heavily on the efficient allocation of resources. Which of the following factors should an IT manager consider regarding the overall scope of preparing for incidents in general? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Downtime, Detection time, Recovery time 
        Downtime is a critical factor to consider to the degree to which an incident disrupts business processes. An incident can either degrade (reduce performance) or interrupt (completely stop) the availability of an asset, system, or business process.

Detection time is an important consideration requiring that the systems used to search for intrusions are thorough, and the response to detections must be fast.

Recovery time must be considered, as some incidents that need to have complex system changes require lengthy remediation. This extended recovery period should trigger heightened alertness for continued or new attacks.</i>
    
<b>14) A security expert needs to review systems information to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. By using NetFlow data, which of the following best describes the primary data the expert reviews?</b>
    <i>Statistics about network traffic -  A flow collector is a means of recording metadata and statistics about network traffic rather than recording each frame. Network traffic and flow data may come from a wide variety of sources.</i>

<b>15) When endpoint security experiences a breach, there are several classes of vector to consider for mitigation. Which type relates to exploiting an unauthorized service port change?</b>
    <i>Configuration Drift -  Configuration drift occurs when changes to system settings, configurations, or service ports are made outside of the established change control process. In this case, the attacker exploited an unauthorized service port change, which falls under the category of configuration drift.</i>
    
<b>16) Arrange the following stages of the incident response life cycle in the correct order.</b>
    <i>Stage 1. Preparation requires making the system resilient to attack in the first place (hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and establishing confidential lines of communication).

        Stage 2. Identification involves determining whether an incident has taken place and assessing how severe it might be, followed by notification of the incident to stakeholders.
        
        Stage 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery are limiting the scope and impact of the incident. Once the incident is contained, the cause can then be removed and the system brought back to a secure state.
        
        Stage 4. Lessons learned consists of analyzing the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident. </i>
       
<h3>Lesson 18: Explaining Digital Forensics</h3>
<b>01) An engineer utilizes digital forensics for information gathering. While doing so, the first focus is counterintelligence. Which concepts does the engineer pursue? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Identificaton and Analysis of specific adversary tactics; Configure and audit active logging systems - 
        Counterintelligence includes the identification and analysis of specific adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). This information furthers the betterment of understanding adversary approaches that counterintelligence can note for monitoring.

        Counterintelligence provides information about how to configure and audit active logging systems so that they are most likely to capture evidence of attempted and successful intrusions. </i>

<b>02) A systems breach occurs at a manufacturer. The system in question contains highly valuable data. An engineer plans a live acquisition, but ultimately, is not successful. What reason may be stopping the engineer?</b>    
    <i>The tools are not preinstalled or running - A specialist hardware or software tool can capture the contents of memory while the host is running (live acquisition). This type of tool needs to be pre-installed or a standalone executable needs to be run, as it requires a kernel mode driver to dump any data of interest. </i>

<b>03) Which term defines the practice of collecting evidence from computer systems to an accepted standard in a court of law?</b>
    <i>Forensics - Computer forensics is the practice of collecting evidence from computer systems to an accepted standard in a court of law. </i>

<b>04) An engineer plans to acquire data from a disk. The disk is connected to the forensics workstation and is ready for the engineer. Which steps indicate a correct order of acquisition as they relate to integrity and non-repudiation?</b>
    <i>1- hash of disk is made; 2- bit-by-bit copy is made; 3- a second hash is made; 4- copy is made of the reference image 
        In the correct first step, the engineer makes a cryptographic hash of the disk media, using either the MD5 or SHA hashing function. The output of the function is a checksum.

        In the correct second step, the engineer makes a bit-by-bit copy of the media using the imaging utility.
        
        In the correct third step, the engineer then makes a second hash of the image, which should match the original hash of the media.
        
        In the correct fourth step, the engineer makes a copy of the reference image and then validates it again by the checksum. The engineer then performs an analysis on the copy.    </i>
    
<b>05) A system breach occurs at a retail distribution center. Data from a persistent disk is required as evidence. No write blocker technology is available. Which approach does a security analyst use to acquire the disk?</b>
    <i>Snapshot - A snapshot is a live acquisition image of a persistent disk. It may have less validity than an image taken from a device using a write blocker technology. </i>
    
<b>06) Which of the following is an example of the process of identifying and de-duplicating files and metadata to be stored for evidence in a trial?</b>
    <i>eDiscovery - eDiscovery is a means of filtering the relevant evidence produced from all the data gathered by a forensic examination and storing it in a database in a format to use as evidence in a trial. </i>
    
<b>07) A systems breach occurs at a financial organization. The system in question contains highly valuable data. When performing data acquisition for an investigation, which component does an engineer acquire first?</b>
    <i>Disk Controller Cache - The order of volatility outlines a general list of which components the engineer should examine for data. The engineer should first examine CPU registers and cache memory (including the cache on disk controllers and GPUs). </i>
    
<b>08) An engineer retrieves data for a legal investigation related to an internal fraud case. The data in question is from an NTFS volume. What will the engineer have to consider with NTFS when documenting a data timeline?</b>
    <i>UTC Time - NTFS uses UTC "internally." When collecting evidence, it is vital to establish the procedure to calculate a timestamp and note the difference between the local system time and UTC. </i>

<b>09) A cloud server has been breached. The organization realizes that data acquisition differs in the cloud when compared to on-premises. What roadblocks may the organization have to consider when considering data? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>On-Demand Services; Jurisdiction; Chain of Custody - 
        The on-demand nature of cloud services means that instances are often created and destroyed again, with no real opportunity for forensic recovery of any data.

        Jurisdiction and data sovereignty may restrict what evidence the CSP is willing to release to the organization.

        Chain of custody issues are complex as it may have to rely on the CSP to select and package data for the organization. </i>
    
<b>10) A security expert archives sensitive data that is crucial to a legal case involving a data breach. The court is holding this data due to its relevance. The expert fully complies with any procedures as part of what legal process?</b>
    <i>Legal Hold - Legal hold refers to information that the security expert must preserve, which may be relevant to a court case. Regulators or the industry's best practice may define the information that is subject to legal hold. </i>
