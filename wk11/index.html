<h3>Lesson 17: Performing Incident Response</h3>
<b>01) A user calls the help desk to report that Microsoft Excel continues to crash when used. The technician would like to review the logs in an attempt to determine the cause. 
        Analyze the types of logs to determine which would contain the information the technician needs.</b>
    <i>Event Log -  An event log records events that occur within an operating system or a software application. These logs diagnose errors and performance problems.</i>

<b>02) A system compromise prompts the IT department to harden all systems. The technicians look to block communications to potential command and control servers. Which solutions apply to working with egress filtering? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>- Restrict DNS lookup
       - Allow only authorized application ports
       A recommended filtering approach would be to restrict DNS lookups to an ISP's DNS services or authorized public resolvers, such as Google's, helps to prevent lookups of malicious hosts.

       A recommended filtering approach would be to allow only authorized application ports and, if possible, restricting the destination addresses to authorized Internet hosts helps to avoid contact with malicious servers.</i>

<b>03) Successful adversarial attacks mostly depend on knowledge of the algorithms used by the target AI. In an attempt to keep an algorithm secret, which method does an engineer use when hiding the secret?</b>
    <i>Obscurity - Algorithm secrecy is secrecy by obscurity (hiding). This approach can partially mitigate risks from less motivated threat actors, who will simply move to the next, easier target. </i>

<b>04) An engineer creates a set of tasks that queries information and runs some PowerShell commands to automate several stages of the process, including the identification of threats and other malicious activity on multiple servers. 
       The engineer defines these tasks using which of the following?</b>
    <i>Runbook -  A runbook aims to automate as many stages of the playbook as possible, while leaving clearly defined interaction points for human analysis.</i>
    
<b>05) A security team desires to modify event logging for several network devices to work over TCP and use secure connections. What uses more types of filter expressions in its configuration file to customize message handling?</b>
    <i>Rsyslog -  Rsyslog can work over TCP and use a secure connection. It uses the same configuration file syntax as Syslog. Rsyslog can use more types of filter expressions in its configuration file to customize message handling.</i>
    
<b>06) The first responder to a security incident decides the issue requires escalation. Consider the following and select the scenario that best describes escalation in this issue.</b>
    <i>The first responder calls senior staff to get them involved. -Escalation is the process of involving additional senior staff to assist in incident management when the first responder feels the situation is too complex to manage alone.  </i>
    
<b>07) During weekly scans, a system administrator identifies a system that has software installed that goes against security policy. The system administrator removes the system from the network in an attempt to limit the effect of the
       incident on the remainder of the network. Apply the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide principles to determine which stage of the incident response life cycle the administrator has entered.</b>
    <i>Containment, Eradication, and Recovery - The system administrator has entered the containment, eradication, and recovery stage by removing the system from the network. This action contains the incident and protects the other network resources. 
        This is also the stage where the administrator will repair the system and bring it back online or replace it. </i>
    
<b>08) A security analyst needs to contain a compromised system with the quickest approach that requires no configuration. Which solution does the analyst utilize?</b>
    <i>Air Gap - A simple option is to disconnect the host from the network completely (creating an air gap) or disabling its switch port. This is the least stealthy option and may reduce opportunities to analyze the attack or malware due to the isolation.</i>

<b>09) A systems administrator suspects that a virus has infected a critical server. In which step of the incident response process does the administrator notify stakeholders of the issue?</b>
    <i>Identification - In the identification phase, it is important to determine whether an incident has taken place, assess how severe it might be (triage), and notify stakeholders. </i>
    
<b>10) The IT team at a company discovers that a Windows server is infected with malware. As a result, the server is not functioning properly. Which event log does the team review to find errors from failing services related to newly installed software?</b>
    <i>Application -  On a Windows system, the application event logs record events generated by applications and services, such as when a service run by a third-party application cannot start.</i>
    
<b>11) An engineer needs to review systems metadata to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. The first step the engineer takes in the investigation is to review MTA information in an Internet header. Which data type does the engineer review?</b>
    <i>Email -  An email's Internet header contains address information for the recipient and sender, plus details of the servers or message Transfer Agents (MTA) handling transmission of the message between them.</i>
    
<b>12) An administrator uses data from a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to identify potential malicious activity. Which feature does the administrator utilize when implementing rules to interpret relationships between datapoints to diagnose incidents?</b>
    <i>Correlation - Correlation means interpreting the relationship between individual data points to diagnose incidents of significance to the security team. A SIEM correlation rule is a statement that matches certain conditions. </i>
    
<b>13) Incident management relies heavily on the efficient allocation of resources. Which of the following factors should an IT manager consider regarding the overall scope of preparing for incidents in general? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Downtime, Detection time, Recovery time 
        Downtime is a critical factor to consider to the degree to which an incident disrupts business processes. An incident can either degrade (reduce performance) or interrupt (completely stop) the availability of an asset, system, or business process.

Detection time is an important consideration requiring that the systems used to search for intrusions are thorough, and the response to detections must be fast.

Recovery time must be considered, as some incidents that need to have complex system changes require lengthy remediation. This extended recovery period should trigger heightened alertness for continued or new attacks.</i>
    
<b>14) A security expert needs to review systems information to conclude what may have occurred during a breach. By using NetFlow data, which of the following best describes the primary data the expert reviews?</b>
    <i>Statistics about network traffic -  A flow collector is a means of recording metadata and statistics about network traffic rather than recording each frame. Network traffic and flow data may come from a wide variety of sources.</i>

<b>15) When endpoint security experiences a breach, there are several classes of vector to consider for mitigation. Which type relates to exploiting an unauthorized service port change?</b>
    <i>Configuration Drift -  Configuration drift occurs when changes to system settings, configurations, or service ports are made outside of the established change control process. In this case, the attacker exploited an unauthorized service port change, which falls under the category of configuration drift.</i>
    
<b>16) Arrange the following stages of the incident response life cycle in the correct order.</b>
    <i>Stage 1. Preparation requires making the system resilient to attack in the first place (hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and establishing confidential lines of communication).

        Stage 2. Identification involves determining whether an incident has taken place and assessing how severe it might be, followed by notification of the incident to stakeholders.
        
        Stage 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery are limiting the scope and impact of the incident. Once the incident is contained, the cause can then be removed and the system brought back to a secure state.
        
        Stage 4. Lessons learned consists of analyzing the incident and responses to identify whether procedures or systems could be improved. It is imperative to document the incident. </i>
       
<h3>Lesson 18: Explaining Digital Forensics</h3>
<b>01) An engineer utilizes digital forensics for information gathering. While doing so, the first focus is counterintelligence. Which concepts does the engineer pursue? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Identificaton and Analysis of specific adversary tactics; Configure and audit active logging systems - 
        Counterintelligence includes the identification and analysis of specific adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). This information furthers the betterment of understanding adversary approaches that counterintelligence can note for monitoring.

        Counterintelligence provides information about how to configure and audit active logging systems so that they are most likely to capture evidence of attempted and successful intrusions. </i>
