<h3>Lesson 10 Review</h3>
<b>Evaluate the functions of a Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and conclude which statements are accurate. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A NIDS can identify and log hosts and applications and detect attack signatures and other indicators of attack. An administrator can analyze logs to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate threats identified.

        One of the main disadvantages of NIDS is that training and tuning are complex, which results in high false positive and false negative rates, especially during initial deployment.</i>

<b>Which of the following are types of log collection for SIEM? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>With the agent-based approach, one must install an agent service on each host. As events occur on the host, logging data is filtered, aggregated, and normalized at the host, then sent to the SIEM server for analysis and storage.

        With the listener/collector approach, rather than installing an agent, hosts can be configured to push updates to the SIEM server using a protocol such as syslog or SNMP. A process runs on the management server to parse and normalize each log/monitoring source.</i>
    
<b>Compare and contrast the characteristics of the various types of firewalls and select the correct explanation of a packet-filtering firewall.</b>
    <i>An administrator configures a packet-filtering firewall by specifying a group of rules called an Access Control List (ACL). Each rule defines a specific type of data packet and the appropriate action to take when a packet matches the rule.</i>

<b>Analyze each statement and determine which describes a fundamental improvement on traditional log management that security information and event management (SIEM) offers.</b>
    <i>SIEM correlates individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Correlation is the principal factor distinguishing it from basic log management.</i>

<b>A network administrator conducts a network assessment to determine where to implement a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Which sensor deployment option is most ideal if the admin is concerned about system overloads and resiliency in the event of power loss?</b>
    <i>With a passive TAP, the monitor port receives every frame—corrupt, malformed, or not—and load does not affect copying.</i>

<b>Which of the following solutions best addresses data availability concerns that may arise with the use of application-aware next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and unified threat management (UTM) solutions?</b>
    <i>While complex NGFW and UTM solutions provide high confidentiality and integrity, lower throughput reduces availability. One solution to this is to treat security solutions for server traffic differently from that for user traffic. An SWG acts as a content filter, which applies user-focused filtering rules and also conducts threat analysis.</i>

<b>Security information and event management (SIEM) collect data inputs from multiple sources. Which of the following is NOT one of the main types of log collection for SIEM?</b>
    <i>AI and machine learning can drive correlation efforts for automated analysis.</i>

<b>A system administrator wants to implement a solution to disguise the internal IP addresses of hosts on a private network from the Internet. What solution does the administrator use to accomplish this goal?</b>
    <i>A NAT gateway translates between a local and public network by substituting private IPs for a public IP and forwarding the requests to the public Internet, thereby concealing private addressing schemes.</i>

<b>A networking administrator is reviewing available security products to further fine-tune the existing firewall and appliance settings. An administrator should analyze which system logs in order to tune firewall rulesets and remove or block suspect hosts and processes from the network?</b>
    <i>Analyzing NIDS logs allows an administrator to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes from the network, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate any identified threats.</i>

<b>A network administrator wants to use a proxy server to prevent external hosts from connecting directly with application servers. Which proxy server implementation will best fit this need?</b>
    <i>Deployed on the network edge, reverse proxy servers protect servers from direct contact with client requests from a public network (the Internet).</i>

<b>Analyze the following scenarios and determine which best simulates the use of a content filter. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A content filter restricts web use to only authorized sites. Examples of content filter uses can be schools restricting access to only sites that are .edu or to not allow sites that have adult-level content.

        Another example of a content filter can be the workplace, only allowing sites that are for work purposes.</i>

<b>Compare and analyze the types of firewalls available to differentiate between them. Choose the answer with the most correct description.</b>
    <i>An application firewall can inspect the contents of packets at the application layer and can analyze the HTTP headers. It also analyzes the HTML code present in HTTP packets, to try to identify code that matches a pattern in its threat database.</i>

<b>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are especially important during which security information and event management (SIEM) task?</b>
    <i>SIEM software can link individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Many SIEM solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as the basis for automated analysis.</i>

<b>Which of the following considerations is most important when employing a signature-based intrusion detection system?</b>
    <i>The signatures and rules (often called plug-ins or feeds) powering intrusion detection need updating regularly to provide protection against the latest threat types.</i>
