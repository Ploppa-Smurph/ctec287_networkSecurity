<h2>Reviews</h2>
<h3>Lesson 10 Review</h3>
<b>Evaluate the functions of a Network-Based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and conclude which statements are accurate. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A NIDS can identify and log hosts and applications and detect attack signatures and other indicators of attack. An administrator can analyze logs to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate threats identified.

        One of the main disadvantages of NIDS is that training and tuning are complex, which results in high false positive and false negative rates, especially during initial deployment.</i>

<b>Which of the following are types of log collection for SIEM? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>With the agent-based approach, one must install an agent service on each host. As events occur on the host, logging data is filtered, aggregated, and normalized at the host, then sent to the SIEM server for analysis and storage.

        With the listener/collector approach, rather than installing an agent, hosts can be configured to push updates to the SIEM server using a protocol such as syslog or SNMP. A process runs on the management server to parse and normalize each log/monitoring source.</i>
    
<b>Compare and contrast the characteristics of the various types of firewalls and select the correct explanation of a packet-filtering firewall.</b>
    <i>An administrator configures a packet-filtering firewall by specifying a group of rules called an Access Control List (ACL). Each rule defines a specific type of data packet and the appropriate action to take when a packet matches the rule.</i>

<b>Analyze each statement and determine which describes a fundamental improvement on traditional log management that security information and event management (SIEM) offers.</b>
    <i>SIEM correlates individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Correlation is the principal factor distinguishing it from basic log management.</i>

<b>A network administrator conducts a network assessment to determine where to implement a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Which sensor deployment option is most ideal if the admin is concerned about system overloads and resiliency in the event of power loss?</b>
    <i>With a passive TAP, the monitor port receives every frame—corrupt, malformed, or not—and load does not affect copying.</i>

<b>Which of the following solutions best addresses data availability concerns that may arise with the use of application-aware next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and unified threat management (UTM) solutions?</b>
    <i>While complex NGFW and UTM solutions provide high confidentiality and integrity, lower throughput reduces availability. One solution to this is to treat security solutions for server traffic differently from that for user traffic. An SWG acts as a content filter, which applies user-focused filtering rules and also conducts threat analysis.</i>

<b>Security information and event management (SIEM) collect data inputs from multiple sources. Which of the following is NOT one of the main types of log collection for SIEM?</b>
    <i>AI and machine learning can drive correlation efforts for automated analysis.</i>

<b>A system administrator wants to implement a solution to disguise the internal IP addresses of hosts on a private network from the Internet. What solution does the administrator use to accomplish this goal?</b>
    <i>A NAT gateway translates between a local and public network by substituting private IPs for a public IP and forwarding the requests to the public Internet, thereby concealing private addressing schemes.</i>

<b>A networking administrator is reviewing available security products to further fine-tune the existing firewall and appliance settings. An administrator should analyze which system logs in order to tune firewall rulesets and remove or block suspect hosts and processes from the network?</b>
    <i>Analyzing NIDS logs allows an administrator to tune firewall rulesets, remove or block suspect hosts and processes from the network, or deploy additional security controls to mitigate any identified threats.</i>

<b>A network administrator wants to use a proxy server to prevent external hosts from connecting directly with application servers. Which proxy server implementation will best fit this need?</b>
    <i>Deployed on the network edge, reverse proxy servers protect servers from direct contact with client requests from a public network (the Internet).</i>

<b>Analyze the following scenarios and determine which best simulates the use of a content filter. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A content filter restricts web use to only authorized sites. Examples of content filter uses can be schools restricting access to only sites that are .edu or to not allow sites that have adult-level content.

        Another example of a content filter can be the workplace, only allowing sites that are for work purposes.</i>

<b>Compare and analyze the types of firewalls available to differentiate between them. Choose the answer with the most correct description.</b>
    <i>An application firewall can inspect the contents of packets at the application layer and can analyze the HTTP headers. It also analyzes the HTML code present in HTTP packets, to try to identify code that matches a pattern in its threat database.</i>

<b>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are especially important during which security information and event management (SIEM) task?</b>
    <i>SIEM software can link individual events or data points (observables) into a meaningful indicator of risk, or Indicator of Compromise (IOC). Many SIEM solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as the basis for automated analysis.</i>

<b>Which of the following considerations is most important when employing a signature-based intrusion detection system?</b>
    <i>The signatures and rules (often called plug-ins or feeds) powering intrusion detection need updating regularly to provide protection against the latest threat types.</i>

<h3>Lesson 11 Review</h3>
<b>When a company attempts to re-register their domain name, they find that an attacker has supplied false credentials to the domain registrar and redirected their host records to a different IP address. What type of attack has occurred?</b>
    <i>In domain hijacking (or brandjacking), the attacker steals a domain name by altering its registration information and then transferring the domain name to another entity.</i>

<b>An authoritative server for a zone creates an RRset signed with a Zone Signing Key. Another server requests a secure record exchange and the authoritative server returns the package along with the public key. Evaluate the scenario to determine what the authoritative server is demonstrating in this situation.</b>
    <i>A DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) transaction is being simulated. This consists of the authoritative server for the zone creating a package of resource records (RRset) signed with a private key (Zone Signing Key). When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can verify the signature.</i>

<b>If an administrator in an exchange server needs to send digitally signed and encrypted messages, what messaging implementation will best suit the administrator’s needs?</b>
    <i>One means of applying authentication and confidentiality on a per-message basis is an email encryption standard called Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). S/MIME adds digital signatures and public key cryptography to mail communications. To use S/MIME, a sender and receiver exchange digital certificates signed by a certification authority (CA).</i>

<b>A security engineer encrypted traffic between a client and a server. Which security protocol is the best for the engineer to configure if an ephemeral key agreement is used?</b>
    <i>Only ephemeral key agreement is supported in TLS 1.3. The signature type is supplied in the certificate, so the cipher suite only lists the bulk encryption key strength and mode of operation (AES_256_GCM), plus the cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA384).</i>

<b>A system administrator needs secure remote access into a Linux server. Evaluate the types of remote administration to recommend which protocol should be used in this situation.</b>
    <i>Secure Shell (SSH) is the principal means of obtaining secure remote access to a UNIX or Linux server. The main uses of SSH are for remote administration and secure file transfer (SFTP).</i>

<b>Transport layer security (TLS) version 1.3 improves upon a vulnerability in TLS1.2. Which statement correctly describes a remedy for this vulnerability?</b>
    <i>TLS 1.3 removes the ability to perform downgrade attacks by preventing the use of unsecure features and algorithms from previous versions.</i>

<b>A system administrator is configuring a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Consider the various types of attacks specific to DHCP and determine which steps the system administrator should take to protect the server. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>The system administrator should use scanning and intrusion detection to pick up suspicious activity.

        The system administrator should set logging to be enabled and then review the logs regularly for suspicious events.
        
        The system administrator should disable unused ports and perform regular physical inspections to ensure that unauthorized devices are not connected via unused jacks.</i>

<b>A technician is working with a user on methods to authenticate their device to the SSH server. Knowing that there are various methods, what can NOT be enabled or disabled when using the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file?</b>
    <i>The server's host key is used to set up a secure channel to use for the client to submit authentication credentials but is not enabled or disabled when using the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.</i>

<b>A security administrator employs a security method that can operate at layer 3 of the OSI model. Which of the following secure communication methods could the security administrator be using?
    (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality and/or authentication and integrity. ESP is one of the two core protocols of IPsec.


        AH is another core protocol of IPsec. The Authentication Header (AH) protocol performs a cryptographic hash on the whole packet, including the IP header, plus a shared secret key (known only to the communicating hosts), and adds this HMAC in its header as an Integrity Check Value (ICV).</i>

<b>An organization routinely communicates directly to a partner company via a domain name. The domain name now leads to a fraudulent site for all users. Systems administrators for the organization find incorrect host records in DNS. What do the administrators believe to be the root cause?</b>
    <i>DNS server cache poisoning aims to corrupt the records held by the DNS server itself. A DNS server queries an authoritative server for domain information. An attacker can masquerade as an authoritative name server and respond with fraudulent information.</i>

<b>A system administrator uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) remote administration tool over TCP port 3389 to manage a server operating Windows 2016. Evaluate the types of remote administration tools to conclude which protocol the administrator is using.</b>
    <i>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is Microsoft's protocol for operating remote connections to a Windows machine. RDP uses TCP port 3389.</i>

<b>Using the STARTTLS method, a system administrator is setting up a new Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) configuration. Make recommendations for how the administrator should configure the ports. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Port 25 is used for message relay between Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers or Message Transfer Agents (MTA). If security is required and supported by both servers, the STARTTLS command can be used to set up the secure connection.
        
        Port 587 is used by mail clients (Message Submission Agents) to submit messages for delivery by an SMTP server.</i>

<b>A  technician is configuring Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) for communications over a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Evaluate the features of available modes and recommend the best option for implementation.</b>
    <i>The technician should use tunnel mode because the whole IP packet, including header and payload, is encrypted and a new IP header added. This mode is used for communications across an unsecure network (creating a VPN).</i>

<b>An attacker modifies the HOSTS file on a workstation to redirect traffic. Consider the types of attacks and deduce which type of attack has likely occurred.</b>
    <i>The HOSTS file is checked before using Domain Name System (DNS). Its contents are loaded into a cache of known names and the client only contacts a DNS server if the name is not cached. If an attacker can place a false name, then the attacker will be able to direct traffic.</i>
