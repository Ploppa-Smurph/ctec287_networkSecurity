<h2>Lesson 04: Identifying Social Engineering and Malware</h2>    
    Objectives: 
      - Compare and contrast social engineering techniques
      - Analyze indicators of malware-based attacks
<h3>04A: Compare and Contrast Social Engineering Techniques</h3>
      People (Employees, Contractors, Suppliers, and Customers) are part of an organizations 'Attack Surface'

    <b><i>Pretext</i></b> - often involves something needing to happen quickly, or an authority figure ordering something done --- all coming from a 2nd / 3rd party source   
           the pretext is often the point of entry for the 'social engineering' attack
    
    - Phishing
    - Spear Phishing
    - Whaling
    - Obtaining Physical Access

    Social Engineering involves tricking a user or group of users 

    check out (on a VM):<a href="http://www.social-engineer.org">Social Engineering security</a> 
<h4>Social Engineering</h4>
     Social Engineering = 'Hacking the Human' 
      Advesaries use a diverse range of techniques: 
        - send generic phishing email to groups of users
        - call help desk pretending to be sales rep needing to set up a connection for remote access
        - trigger fire alarm and slip in during confusion and attach monitoring device to network port
<h4>Social Engineering Principles</h4>
      <b>Familiarity / Liking</b> - charisma and persuasion; low risk because social engineer can move forward in the background later
      
      <b>Consensu / Social Proof</b> - uses most people's 'need to fit in' to steer them into doing what the social engineer wants
      
      <b>Authority and Intimidation</b> - pretend to be Senior executive or authority figure (ex: judge, police officer, doctor); more advesarial than 'familiarity/liking'
      
      <b>Scarcity and Urgency</b> - used to make people feel they need to act quickly; often used as sales tactic  
<h4>Impersonation and Trust</h4>
      <b>Impersonation</b> - pretending to be someone you are not
      
      <b>Pretexting</b> - ex: you call into a specific department at a business and let someone know there is an error with the system and you need their password to remotely correct the system
    
      using privileged information during the impersonation can help the social engineer gain 'Trust'
<h4>Dumpster Diving and Tailgating</h4>
      <b>Dumpster Diving</b> - digging through organization's garbage to find useful information / data 
      
      <b>Tailgating</b> - entering a secure area without authorization by following a person and entering with them
       <b>Piggy backing</b> - similar, but enter a secure location with employee's permission; ex: if you had a mop bucket and acted like part of a cleaning crew
<h4>Identity Fraud and Invoice Scams</h4>
      <b>Identity Fraud</b> - type of impersonation where attacker uses personal details of someone else's identity
      
      <b>Credential Databases</b> - use <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to check if old passwords are reused

      <b>Shoulder Surfing</b> - learn password or PIN by watching someone type it

      <b>Lunctime Attack</b> - accessing a system while user is away and using their authorization; mitigate by setting up password lock after inactivity and having users logout EVERYTIME they step away from the system
<h4>Phishing, Whaling, and Vishing</h4>
      <b>Phishing</b> - combination of Social Engineering attack and Spoofing; tricks target into interacting with malicious resource disguised as a trusted one 

      <b>Spear Phishing</b> - more directed to an individual; has some information that makes it look legitimate to the recepient of the email

      <b>Whaling</b> - spear phishing directed at upper levels of management

      <b>Vishing</b> - phishing attack conducted through voice channel; target actually calls someone purporting to be an organizational representitive

      <b>SMiShing</b> - text (SMS) Short Message Service
<h4>Spam, Hoaxes, and Prepending</h4>
      <b>Spam</b> - unsolicited email; <b>Spim</b> if done over instant messaging

      <b>Hoaxes</b> - security alerts / chain emails; <b>Malvertising</b> - uses CDN (Contend Delivery Network) space on a website and inserts malicious site information there

      <b>Prepending</b> - adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system; ex: "RE:" in the subject line
<h4>Pharming and Credential Harvesting</h4>
      <b>Pharming</b> - redirect user from legitimate site to malicious one; relies on corrupting a computer's Name Resolution 

      <b>Typosquatting</b> - register a site similar to a legitimate one hoping someone will mistype the name and end up at malicious site

      <b>Watering Hole Attack</b> - finding out where employees like to visit, or website/forum many employees frequent; then attacking the website/forum and trying to get information about the employees that way

      <b>Credential Harvesting</b> - campaign designed to steal account credentials
<h4>Influence Campaigns</h4>
      Influence Campaigns are launched by adversaries with a high level of capability. (ex: hactivist group, nation state, terrorist group)
        used to shift public opinion on a topic (ex: election influence)
<h3>04B: Analyze Indicators of Malware-Based Attacks</h3>   
<h4>Malware Classification</h4>
      <b>Viruses and Worms</b> -  viruses infect executable files; worms infect RAM; both are designed to replicate

      <b>Trojan</b> - Malware concealed in software that appears to be legitimate; designed to operate without detection (not replicate)

      <b>Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)
          Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs)</b> - Software installed alongside a package selected to be installed -- normally bundled in with other software; grayware (not necessarily malware)
<h4>Computer Viruses</h4>
      Virus is designed to replicate from device to device by 'infecting' executable applications or code
      <b>Non-resident / File Infector</b> -  virus contained within executable file that runs with host process.

      <b>Memory Resident</b> - when host is executed virus creates process for itself in memory

      <b>Boot</b> - code is written in boot sector and executes as memory resident process when OS starts

      <b>Script and Macro Virus</b> - uses features available in local scripting engines 

      <b>Multipartite</b> - virus that uses multiple attack vectors

      <b>Polymorphic</b> - virus that changes or obfuscate's code to evade detection
<h4>Computer Worms and Fileless Malware</h4>
      Worm is memory-resident malware that runs without user intervention and replicates over network resources. 
        ex: <i>Code-Red worm</i> - used buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft IIS web server software
        ex02: <i>Conflicker worm</i> - remote code execution and memory-resident
      
     <b>Fileless Malware behaviors</b>: 
         - does not write code to disk; uses Memory-resident techniques to run it's own process
         - uses lightweight 'shellcode' to achieve a backdoor mechanism on the host. 'shellcode' is easily obfuscated to evade detection
         - 'live off the land' techniques to evade detection, uses legitimiate scripting tools

        modern 'live off the land' type fileless malware can be referred to as <b><i>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)</i></b> or <b><i>Advanced Volatile Threat</i></b> 
<h4>Spyware and Keyloggers</h4>
      <b>Tracking Cookies</b> - if permitted by browser, 3rd party cookies will record pages visited, IP address, and other user metadata
      
      <b>Adware</b> - class of PUP/grayware that performs browser reconfiguration (ex: allowing tracking cookies, change default search engine, open sponser pages at startup)
                        can be a program or browser extension
      <b>Spyware</b> - performs adware like tracking, plus can take screenshots, activate recording devices, or perform DNS redirection to 'pharming' sites

      <b>Keylogger</b> - attempts to steal confidential information by recording keystrokes in hopes of gaining password or credit card information
<h4>Backdoors and Remote Access Trojans</h4>
    <b>backdoor</b> - allows adminitrative access without usual authentication methods    

    <b>Remote Access Trojan (RAT)</b> - mimics legitimate remote control app, but designed to work covertly

    <b>botnet</b> - multiple hosts infected can be controlled by a 'herder program' 
          botnets can be used for many malicious purposes, ex: DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), Spam campaigns, or cryptomining

    <b>Command and Control (C2 or C&C)</b> - host of the botnet (herder / zombie king)      
<h4>Rootkits</h4>
     run at System / Administrator level. can change settings and be difficult to detect or remove
<h4>Ransomware, Crypto-Malware, and Logic Bombs</h4>
    <b>Ransomware</b> - tries to extort money from victim

    <b>Crytpo-Malware</b> - uses infected computer resources to run crypto mining

    <b>Logic Bomb</b> - the event that triggers the undesirable event. 
       ex: disgruntled system admin creates scripted trap that runs if their user account is deleted; this 'logic bomb' is known as a 'mine'
       ex02: event is scheduled to run at specific date and time; example of a 'time bomb'
<h4>Malware Indicators</h4>
    <b>Antivirus Notifications</b> - good AV software should notify user; mostly for EPPs (End Protection Platforms)

    <b>Resource Consumption</b> - abnormal resource consumption can be monitored using <i>Task Manager</i> or <i>top</i> in Linux
                 resource consumption is a sign to more deeply check a system, not definitive proof

    <b>File System</b> - aka 'Anomaly Analysis' - checks to see if malware has interacted with filesystem or registry

    <b>Sandbox Execution</b> - used to test suspect code in a more controlled environment; isolated from the host
                 most sandbox programs record filesystem and registry changes, along with network activity
<h4>Process Analysis</h4>
    <b>Abnormal Process Behavior</b> - system deviations that can point to system infections
        mitgation: be aware of standard system benchmarks 

    Microsoft <b><i>Sysinternals</i></b> is a suite of tools designed to assist in trouble shooting windows issues   

    aside from viewing how a process interacts with the files system; <b><i>Network Activity</i></b> is another reliable way to identify malware.
<h3>Lesson 04 Quiz</h3>    
    <b>A system administrator has just entered their credentials to enter a secure server room. As the administrator is entering the door, someone is walking up to the door with their hands full of equipment and appears to be struggling to move items around while searching for their credentials. The system administrator quickly begins to assist by getting 
        items out of the person's hands, and they walk into the room together. This person is not an employee, but someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the server room. What type of social engineering has occurred?</b>    
       <i>Consensus/social proof revolves around the belief that without an explicit instruction to behave in a certain way, people will follow social norms. It is typically polite to assist someone with their hands full.</i> 

    <b>A user's PC is infected with a virus that appears to be memory resident and loads anytime it is booted from an external universal serial bus (USB) thumb drive. Examine the following options and determine which describes the infection type.</b>
        <i>With a boot virus, code is written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media. The code executes as a memory resident process when the OS starts.</i>
    
    <b>An employee calls IT personnel and states that they received an email with a PDF document to review. After the PDF was opened, the system has not been performing correctly. An IT admin conducted a scan and found a virus. Determine the two classes of viruses the computer most likely has. (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Both a macro and script virus can use a PDF as a vector. The user stated that a PDF file was recently opened. A macro virus is executed when an application is executed. Executable objects can also be embedded or attached within other file types such as Microsoft Word and Rich Text Format.

            A script virus typically targets vulnerabilities in an interpreter. Scripts are powerful languages used to automate operating system functions and add interactivity to web pages and are executed by an interpreter rather than self-executing. PDF documents have become a popular vector for script viruses.</i>    
    
    <b>A hacker is able to install a keylogger on a user's computer. What is the hacker attempting to do in this situation?</b>    
        <i>Keyloggers actively attempt to steal confidential information by recording the keystrokes of a user.</i>    

    <b>A malicious party adds malware to a popular video game and offers free copies to users. The party's objective is to require the CD to be inserted during use. This software will gain administrative rights, change system files, and may hide from detection without the knowledge or consent of the user. 
        Consider the malware characteristics and determine which may be used.  (Select all that apply)</b>
       <i>A rootkit is characterized by its ability to hide itself by changing core system files and programming interfaces and to escalate privileges. The gaming company accomplished this.

        Trojans cannot conceal their presence entirely and will surface as a running process or service. While a rootkit is a type of Trojan, it differs in its ability to hide itself.</i>     
    
    <b>An individual receives a text message that appears to be a warning from a well-known order fulfillment company, informing them that the carrier has tried to deliver his package twice, and that if the individual does not contact them to claim it, the package will not be delivered. 
        Analyze the scenario and select the social engineering technique being used.</b>    
       <i>SMiShing attempts use short message service (SMS) text communications as the vector.</i> 

    <b>Which of the following depict ways a malicious attacker can gain access to a target's network? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
       <i>Phishing and shoulder surfing are social engineering attacks. Phishing occurs when an attacker sends a legitimate-looking, spoofed e-mail to a user of the spoofed site to trick the user into revealing private information.
 
        Shoulder surfing is used to obtain someone’s password or PIN by observing a user typing it on the keyboard. Social engineering is malicious behavior meant to get users to reveal confidential information.</i> 

    <b>Which situation would require keyboard encryption software to be installed on a computer?</b>
       <i>Keyboard encryption software is used to protect against keyloggers, which record keystrokes for the purpose of stealing data. Keyloggers are spyware.</i>    

    <b>An employee is having coffee at an outdoor coffee shop and is not taking precautions against someone watching their screen while working on a company project. A person a few tables over watches the employee enter their credentials and then takes photos of the work they are completing with their smartphone.  
        Which form of social engineering is being used in this situation?</b>   
       <i>Shoulder surfing is stealing a password by watching the user type it. Although the attacker was not looking over the employee’s shoulder, the login credentials were obtained through observation.</i> 

    <b>Analyze the following attacks to determine which best illustrates a pharming attack.</b>    
       <i>Pharming is a means of redirecting users from a legitimate website to a malicious one that relies on corrupting the way the victim's computer performs IP address resolution. This is illustrated in the bank customer scenario.</i> 
<h2>Lesson 05: Summarizing Basic Cryptographic Concepts</h2>
    Objectives: 
    - Compare and contrast cryptographic ciphers
    - Summarize cryptographic modes of operation
    - Summarize cryptographic use cases and weaknesses
    - Summarize other cryptographic technologies
<h3>05A: Compare and Contrast Cryptographic Ciphers</h3>
      <b>Cipher</b> - operations performed to encode or decode data.         
<h4>Cryptographic Concepts</h4>
      <b>Cryptography</b> - secret writing; make information secure by encoding it
      
      <b>Plaintext</b> - unencrypted; easily readable

      <b>Ciphertext</b> - encrypted message

      <b>Cipher</b> - process (algorithm) used to encrypt and decrypt a message

      <b>cryptanalysis</b> - art of cracking cryptographic system

      <b>Alice</b> - sender of genuine message

      <b>Bob</b> - intended recipient of message

      <b>Mallory</b> - malicious attacker attempting to subvert message in some way
<h4>Hashing Algorithms</h4>
     - simplest cryptographic operation
     - allows user to tell if a file has been changed / tampered with
     - used to prove integrity of data, NOT store or transmit data

      <b>Cryptographic Hashing Algorithm</b> - adds information to plaintext to increase the plaintext length and make it harder to guess
           aka: checksum, hash, message digest 
           
    2 Hash Algorithms: 
      <b>Seucure Hash Algorithm (SHA)</b> - considered strongest, most popular is SHA-256 (256-bit digest)

      <b>Message Digest Algorithm #5 (MD5)</b> - produces a 128-bit digest, still used in some security products 
<h4>Encryption Ciphers and Keys</h4>
     <b>Substitution and Transposition Ciphers</b>    
        <b>Substitution Cipher</b> - involves replacing units (letter or block of letters) in the plaintext with a different ciphertext
                ex: <i>ROT13</i> (a Caesar Cipher) rotates each letter 13 places ('A' becomes 'N')

        <b>Transpoition Cipher</b> - units stay the same in plaintext or ciphertext, their position changes
                ex: <i>Rail Fence Cipher</i> -- letters are written in rows and then the columns are concatenated to reveal the answer

        <b>Key</b> - used to unlock ciphertext     
<h4>Symmetric Encryption</h4>
    used for 'Confidentiality'; encryption and decryption are performed by the same 'secret-key'
     1) Alice and Bob meet and agree which cipher to use and decide on a 'secret-key' value
           they both record the value of the secret-key
     2) Alice encrypts a file using the cipher and key
     3) Alice sends the ciphertext to Bob
     4) Bob receives the ciphertext and is able to decrypt it applying the known 'secret-key'
     
    Symmetric encryption is fast and used for 'bulk encryption' of large data sources

    Symmetric encryption NOT used for authentication or integrity 
<h4>Stream and Block Ciphers</h4>
    <b>Stream Cipher</b> - each byte is encrypted 1 at a time
    
    <b>Block Cipher</b> - plaintext is divided into equal-size blocks (normally 128-bit)
       <b>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</b> - basic AES = 128-bit; AES256 = 256-bit   
    
    <b>Keyspace</b> - range of key values available for a particular cipher
    
    ** key-length strength is not comparable between algorigthms; it depends on how strong each algorithm is to brute-force attack **
<h4>Asymmetric Encryption</h4> 
  
  CAN be used to prove identity (Authentication)
   <b><i>KEY PAIR</i></b>
   <b>Public Key</b> - shared; used for encryption

   <b>Private Key</b> - secure and unique; used for decryption

   ex: 
    1) Bob generates a key pair and keeps the 'private key' secret. Bob publishes the 'public key'
    2) Alice wants to send Bob a confidential message. Alice takes a copy of Bob's 'public key'
    3) Alice uses Bob's 'public key' to encrypt a message. 
    4) Alice sends Bob the ciphertext.
    5) Bob receives the message and is able to decrypt using his 'private key'
    6) If Mallory is snooping, she can obtain a copy of the ciphertext message and the 'public key'. 
    7) Mallory cannot decrypt the message without the 'private key' and therefore the system remains secure. 

     Asymmetric encryption requires more computer overhead, takes longer, and the encrypted data can only be as large as the 'key size'.
       - Asymmetric encryption is NOT used for large files
       - Asymmetric encryption is often used for <b><i>'Key agreement/exchange'</i></b> to share a 'secret symmetric key' for bulk encryption with no one discovering. 
<h4>Public Key Cryptographic Algorithms</h4>
    <b>Asymmetric Encryption</b> - aka <i>Public Key Cryptography</i>, 
        based on <b>RSA Algorithm</b>, aka <i>'Trapdoor function'</i>

    <b>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</b> - another type of 'trapdoor function', more secure than RSA
        a 256-bit ECC encoded ciphtext is roughly equivelant in strength to a 2048-bit RSA 
<h3>05B: Summarize Cryptographic Modes of Operation</h3>
     <b>Mode of Operation</b> - means of using a cipher within a product to acheive a security goal (ie: confidentiality, or integrity) 
<h4>Digital Signatures</h4>
     <b>digital signature</b> - hashing a public key to confirm the integrity of the sender 

     Process of Creating RSA Digital Signature:  
       1) Alice (sender) creates a digest/hash, using a pre-agreed hash algorithm, and encrypts the hash using her private key.
            This creates Alice's digital signature.
       2) Alice attaches the digital signature and sends both the message and public key to Bob (receiver).
       3) Bob decrypts the digital signature using Alice's public key, resulting in the digest of the message.
       4) Bob then creates a digest of the message, using the same pre-agreed hash algorithm Alice used. Bob compares the digests.
           -- If the 2 digests are the same the data has not been tampered with during transmission 
           -- If the message had been tampered with, or the sender key had changed, the 2 digests would NOT be the same.

     <b>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)</b> - uses ECC (Eliptic Curve Cryptography) rather than RSA
<h4>Digital Envelopes and Key Exchange</h4>
     <b>Digital Envelope</b> - the use of both asymmetric encryption to pass a secure secret key to allow the passing of symmetrically encrypted data    

     <b>Key Exchange</b> - method of tranferring cryptographic keys among users enabling the use of a cryptographic algorithm.
     
     <b>Key Exchange Steps</b>:
        1) ALice obtains a copy of Bob's public key.
        2) Alice encrypts her message using a secret hey cipher, such as AES. 'secret key' is refered to as <i>'Session Key'</i>.
        3) Alice encrypts the session key with Bob's public key.
        4) Alice attaches the encrypted session key to the ciphertext message in a digital envelope and sends it to Bob.
        5) Bob uses his 'private key' to decrypt the 'Session Key'.
        6) Bob uses the session key to decrypt the ciphertext message. 

    in this process: 
      - Recipient's 'public key' is used to perform the encryption.
      - recipient's 'private key' is used for decryption. 
<h4>Digital Certificates</h4>
      a 3rd party, the <b><i>Certificate Authority (CA)</i></b>, validates the owners of the public key by issuing a certificate. 

      <b>Public Key Infrastructure</b> - the process of issuing and verifying certificates
<h4>Perfect Forward Secrecy</h4>
    <b>PFS Perfect Forward Secrecy</b> - mitigate risk of RSA key exchange
        PFS uses <i>DH (Diffie-Hellman)</i> key agreement to create ephemeral <i>'Session keys'</i> without using the server's private key 

     DHE/EDH (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode)
     (ECDHE) Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode         
<h4>Cipher Suites and Modes of Operation</h4>
      - Signature algorithm - 

      - Key Exchange / Agreement Algorithm - 

       AES
       
       Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode - applies initialization vector (IV)
            - cipher is created from plain text block with IV, that cipher is added to the next block and so on down the line 
            - XOR operations add the output of the 1st ciphertext block to the  next plaintext block and repeated through the full 'chain'
               this ensures that no plaintext block produces the same ciphertext.  

           ** CBC needs padding to ensure data in block is an exact multiple of the block size
           
           *** CBC suffers from the <b>'padding attack'</b> ***

       XOR - logical operation that outputs '1 / True' when one input is True and the other input is False

       Counter Mode (CTM) - AES algorithm works as stream cipher. 
           - Counter Mode applies IV (initialization vector) along with an 'incrementing counter value' to generate keystream
           - keystream is then XOR'ed to data in plaintext blocks.
           - each block can be processed individually, or in parallel, greatly improving performance 
           ** CTM does NOT need padding 
<h4>Authenticates Modes of Operation</h4>
      symettric algorithms do NOT provide message integrity or authentication. 
      CBC and Counter Modes of operation are unauthenticated and are vulnerable to data being inserted or modified 
      
      <b>Chosen Ciphertext Attack</b> - modifying or inserting data into the symmetric algorithm to break the encryption scheme 

    <b>Authenticated Encryption</b> - provides authentication and integrity by hashing message output and shared secret key. 
             authentication encryption scheme is specified by it's separate function: ex: AES CBC with HMAC-SHA
             ** AES CBC authentication is vulnerable to a cryptographic <i>'padding oracle attack'</i>.   

    <b>Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD)</b> - 
            Stream cipher / counter modes are strongly preferred (because of the 'Padding attack' on CBC)
            
        Stream ciphers use <i>'Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data'</i> - the receiver uses the message header to ensure payload has not been replayed from a different location.

        AEAD mode is identified by a single hyphenated function name (ex: AES-GCM or AES-CCM)

        - ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an alternative stream cipher to AES
<h3>05C: Summarize Cryptographic Use Cases and Weakness</h3>
<h4>Cryptography Supporting Authentication and Non-Repudiation</h4>
      <b>Cryptographic Primitive</b> - hash, symmetric cipher, and asymmetric cipher 

      multiple cryptographic primitives are used in more complex 'cryptographic system' 

      ** Encryption can form the basis of Identification, Authentication, and Access Control Systems

      Non-repudiation -- concept that sender cannot deny sending a message
      
      to support Authentication and Non-repudiation recipients can <b>decrypt</b>, but NOT encrypt.
         (use case is similare to aymmetric encryption cipher and public/private key pairs)

      <b>User/Server</b> generates linked keys -> <i>Private Key</i> is stored securely and protected
         ** imparitive only User/Server be able to use the private key. 
        the <i>Public Key</i> is given to clients usually in the form of a digitat certificate 
<h4>Cryptography Supporting Confidentiality</h4>
       if ciphertext is intercepted by a threat actor they will not be able to change what has been stolen.

    Cryptography supports confidentiallity 

    RSA (Asymmetric) encryption is too slow to encrypt an entire disk or large file. 
    AES (Symmetric) is fast enough that it can encrypt and decrypt streaming data more quickly 
        but it is difficult to distribute the private key securely. 

    that is why both Asymmetric (RSA) and Symmetric (AES) encryption are used -- encrypt the key Asymmetrically and the data symmetrically

    - File Encryption (data-at-rest) - private key is written to TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and is only available when user is 'authenticated'

    - Transport Encryption (data-in-transit) - uses 'digital envelopes' or 'perfect forward secrecy'
       ex: HTTPS - the web server is allocated a key pair and stores the private key. the 'Public Key' is distributed via <b><i>Digital Certificate</i></b> 
             The client and server agree on 1 or more AES cipher keys to use as 'session keys'
