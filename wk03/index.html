<h2>Lesson 04: Identifying Social Engineering and Malware</h2>    
    Objectives: 
      - Compare and contrast social engineering techniques
      - Analyze indicators of malware-based attacks
<h3>04A: Compare and Contrast Social Engineering Techniques</h3>
      People (Employees, Contractors, Suppliers, and Customers) are part of an organizations 'Attack Surface'

    <b><i>Pretext</i></b> - often involves something needing to happen quickly, or an authority figure ordering something done --- all coming from a 2nd / 3rd party source   
           the pretext is often the point of entry for the 'social engineering' attack
    
    - Phishing
    - Spear Phishing
    - Whaling
    - Obtaining Physical Access

    Social Engineering involves tricking a user or group of users

<h4>Social Engineering</h4>
     Social Engineering = 'Hacking the Human' 
      Advesaries use a diverse range of techniques: 
        - send generic phishing email to groups of users
        - call help desk pretending to be sales rep needing to set up a connection for remote access
        - trigger fire alarm and slip in during confusion and attach monitoring device to network port
<h4>Social Engineering Principles</h4>
      <b>Familiarity / Liking</b> - charisma and persuasion; low risk because social engineer can move forward in the background later
      
      <b>Consensu / Social Proof</b> - uses most people's 'need to fit in' to steer them into doing what the social engineer wants
      
      <b>Authority and Intimidation</b> - pretend to be Senior executive or authority figure (ex: judge, police officer, doctor); more advesarial than 'familiarity/liking'
      
      <b>Scarcity and Urgency</b> - used to make people feel they need to act quickly; often used as sales tactic  
<h4>Impersonation and Trust</h4>
      <b>Impersonation</b> - pretending to be someone you are not
      
      <b>Pretexting</b> - ex: you call into a specific department at a business and let someone know there is an error with the system and you need their password to remotely correct the system
    
      using privileged information during the impersonation can help the social engineer gain 'Trust'
<h4>Dumpster Diving and Tailgating</h4>
      <b>Dumpster Diving</b> - digging through organization's garbage to find useful information / data 
      
      <b>Tailgating</b> - entering a secure area without authorization by following a person and entering with them
       <b>Piggy backing</b> - similar, but enter a secure location with employee's permission; ex: if you had a mop bucket and acted like part of a cleaning crew
<h4>Identity Fraud and Invoice Scams</h4>
      <b>Identity Fraud</b> - type of impersonation where attacker uses personal details of someone else's identity
      
      <b>Credential Databases</b> - use <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to check if old passwords are reused

      <b>Shoulder Surfing</b> - learn password or PIN by watching someone type it

      <b>Lunctime Attack</b> - accessing a system while user is away and using their authorization; mitigate by setting up password lock after inactivity and having users logout EVERYTIME they step away from the system
<h4>Phishing, Whaling, and Vishing</h4>
      <b>Phishing</b> - combination of Social Engineering attack and Spoofing; tricks target into interacting with malicious resource disguised as a trusted one 

      <b>Spear Phishing</b> - more directed to an individual; has some information that makes it look legitimate to the recepient of the email

      <b>Whaling</b> - spear phishing directed at upper levels of management

      <b>Vishing</b> - phishing attack conducted through voice channel; target actually calls someone purporting to be an organizational representitive

      <b>SMiShing</b> - text (SMS) Short Message Service
<h4>Spam, Hoaxes, and Prepending</h4>
      <b>Spam</b> - unsolicited email; <b>Spim</b> if done over instant messaging

      <b>Hoaxes</b> - security alerts / chain emails; <b>Malvertising</b> - uses CDN (Contend Delivery Network) space on a website and inserts malicious site information there

      <b>Prepending</b> - adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system; ex: "RE:" in the subject line
<h4>Pharming and Credential Harvesting</h4>
      <b>Pharming</b> - redirect user from legitimate site to malicious one; relies on corrupting a computer's Name Resolution 

      <b>Typosquatting</b> - register a site similar to a legitimate one hoping someone will mistype the name and end up at malicious site

      <b>Watering Hole Attack</b> - finding out where employees like to visit, or website/forum many employees frequent; then attacking the website/forum and trying to get information about the employees that way

      <b>Credential Harvesting</b> - campaign designed to steal account credentials
<h4>Influence Campaigns</h4>
