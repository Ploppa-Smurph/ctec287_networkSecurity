<h3>Lesson 19: Summarizing Risk Management Concepts</h3>
<b>01) Senior company executives identify priorities during a risk management exercise. Which risk management approach is applied?</b>
    <i>Risk Posture - Risk posture refers to the overall status and stance of an organization towards identified risks. By identifying and prioritizing risks, 
        management is defining its risk posture, which provides insight into which risk response options are identified and deemed essential. </i>

<b>02) A company performs risk management. Which action identifies a risk response approach?</b>
    <i>A company develops a countermeasure for an identified risk - The fifth phase of risk management is identifying risk response. A countermeasure should be
        identified for each risk and the cost of deploying additional security controls should be assessed. </i> 
    
<b>03) A  company determines the mean amount of time to replace or recover a system. What has the company calculated?</b>
    <i>MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) is a measure of the time taken to correct a fault to restore the system to full operation. 
        This is also known as a mean time to replace or recover and is important in determining the overall Recovery Time Objective (RTO).</i>
    
<b>04) Select the phase of risk management a company has performed if they analyzed workflows and identified critical tasks that could cause their business to fail, if not performed.</b>
    <i>Identify mission essential functions -  The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure so 
        it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.</i>
    
<b>05) Evaluate the metrics associated with Mission Essential Functions (MEF) to determine which example is demonstrating Work Recovery Time (WRT).</b>
    <i>It takes three hours to restore a system from backup, reintegrate the system, and test functionality. -  Work Recovery Time (WRT) is the additional time that it takes to restore data from backup, 
        reintegrate different systems, and test overall functionality. This can also include briefing system users on any changes or different working practices so that the business function is again fully supported.</i>
    
<b>06) Analyze the metrics governing Mission Essential Functions (MEF) and determine which example demonstrates Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD).</b>
    <i>A business function relies on five hours for restoration; otherwise, there is an irrecoverable business failure. - The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is the longest period of time a business function outage may occur without causing irrecoverable business failure.</i>
    
<b>07) A risk manager is tasked with evaluating and implementing conditions set within the phases of the risk management process after the organization suffers a catastrophic failure in one of its locations. 
    Which statement is NOT true regarding the phases associated with the risk management process?</b>
    <i>Assessing the cost of deploying additional security controls is associated with analyzing business impacts. 
        - When reviewing the phases of the risk management process, assessing the cost of deploying additional security controls is associated with identifying risk response versus analyzing business impacts.</i>

<b>08) Select the example that provides an accurate simulation of a company engaging in the identifying threats phase of risk management.</b>
    <i>A company conducts research to determine which vulnerabilities may be exploited. - The third phase of risk management is identify threats. 
        Threats that may take advantage of, exploit, or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities. Threat refers to the sources or motivations of people and things that could cause loss or damage.</i>
    
<b>09) A company has 30 servers, each running for 125 hours before it needs maintenance. During this time, three servers fail. Rounding to the nearest whole number, calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for this scenario.</b>
    <i>1250 - The calculation for Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the total time divided by the number of total failures. In this scenario, the company has 30 servers that run for 125 hours (30x125), 
        with the resulting product of 3,750. This result is then divided by the number of failures (3,750/3), which equals an MTBF of 1,250.</i>
    
<h3>Lesson 20: Implementing Cybersecurity Resilience</h3>
<b>01) A systems engineer reviews recent backups for a production server. While doing so, the engineer discovers that archive bits on files are clearing and incorrect backup types have been occurring. 
    Which backup type did the engineer intend to use if the bit should not be cleared?</b>
    <i>Differential - With a differential backup, all new and modified files since the last full backup are part of the backup set. 
        With a differential backup type, the archive bit on a file is set to not cleared.</i>

<b>02) A critical server has a high availability requirement of 99.99%. What would be a tolerable downtime based on this requirement?</b>
    <i>0:49:23 annual downtime - The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) metric states the requirement for a particular business function. 
        High availability is usually described as 24x7. For a critical system, availability will be described from 99% to 99.9999%. 
        In this scenario, the requirement is 99.99%, resulting in the maximum downtime of 00:52:34. Since 00:49:23 is less downtime than the maximum requirement, this results in the system meeting the requirement.</i> 
    
<b>03) A systems engineer configures a disk volume with a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) solution. Which solution does the engineer utilize when allowing for the failure of two disks?</b>
    <i>Level 6 - Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Level 6 has double parity or Level 5 with an additional parity stripe. This allows the volume to continue when two disks have been lost.</i>
    
<b>04) Analyze data processing use cases to differentiate between elasticity and scalability. Which scenarios demonstrate scalability? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A data processing company doubles its service demands to clients without doubling its operational costs.; 
        A data processing company reaches a 50% load increase during peak hours that resulted in a 10% increase in resource costs. - 
        Scalability is the capacity to increase resources to meet demand within similar cost ratios. This means that if service demand doubles, costs do not more than double. Systems may scale out or up.

        Another example of scalability is when workload increases by 50% but resource costs increase by only 10%. Resource costs should not double if systems are scalable.</i>
    
<b>05) An organization configures both a warm site and a hot site for disaster preparedness. Doing so poses which challenges for the organization? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Complexity; Budgetary - Creating a duplicate of anything doubles the complexity of securing that resource properly. Having multiple sites increases the complexity of the infrastructure.
 
        Providing redundancy on a scale that includes multiple locations can be very expensive. Businesses often lease sites from service providers to reduce costs.</i>
    
<b>06) A Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is installed with data written to two disks with 50% storage efficiency. Which RAID level has been utilized?</b>
    <i>Level 1 - Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Level 1 uses mirroring where data is written to two disks simultaneously, which provides redundancy. The main drawback is its storage efficiency is only 50%.</i>
    
<b>07) DataNet Solutions, a growing data analytics firm, is enhancing its data center to prevent potential downtime due to power failures. They understand the criticality of maintaining power to their servers and 
    want to ensure all systems remain operational or can be safely shut down during power outages. What power redundancy strategies should DataNet Solutions prioritize to safeguard their data center operations against power interruptions?</b>
    <i>Implement dual power supplies in servers and managed PDUs. - Dual power supplies and managed PDUs offer redundancy, ensuring that if one power source fails, another can take over without interrupting operations.</i>
