<h3>Lesson 19: Summarizing Risk Management Concepts</h3>
<b>01) Senior company executives identify priorities during a risk management exercise. Which risk management approach is applied?</b>
    <i>Risk Posture - Risk posture refers to the overall status and stance of an organization towards identified risks. By identifying and prioritizing risks, 
        management is defining its risk posture, which provides insight into which risk response options are identified and deemed essential. </i>

<b>02) A company performs risk management. Which action identifies a risk response approach?</b>
    <i>A company develops a countermeasure for an identified risk - The fifth phase of risk management is identifying risk response. A countermeasure should be
        identified for each risk and the cost of deploying additional security controls should be assessed. </i> 
    
<b>03) A  company determines the mean amount of time to replace or recover a system. What has the company calculated?</b>
    <i>MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) is a measure of the time taken to correct a fault to restore the system to full operation. 
        This is also known as a mean time to replace or recover and is important in determining the overall Recovery Time Objective (RTO).</i>
    
<b>04) Select the phase of risk management a company has performed if they analyzed workflows and identified critical tasks that could cause their business to fail, if not performed.</b>
    <i>Identify mission essential functions -  The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure so 
        it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.</i>
    
<b>05) Evaluate the metrics associated with Mission Essential Functions (MEF) to determine which example is demonstrating Work Recovery Time (WRT).</b>
    <i>It takes three hours to restore a system from backup, reintegrate the system, and test functionality. -  Work Recovery Time (WRT) is the additional time that it takes to restore data from backup, 
        reintegrate different systems, and test overall functionality. This can also include briefing system users on any changes or different working practices so that the business function is again fully supported.</i>
    
<b>06) Analyze the metrics governing Mission Essential Functions (MEF) and determine which example demonstrates Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD).</b>
    <i>A business function relies on five hours for restoration; otherwise, there is an irrecoverable business failure. - The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is the longest period of time a business function outage may occur without causing irrecoverable business failure.</i>
    
<b>07) A risk manager is tasked with evaluating and implementing conditions set within the phases of the risk management process after the organization suffers a catastrophic failure in one of its locations. Which statement is NOT true regarding the phases associated with the risk management process?</b>
    <i>C.Assessing the cost of deploying additional security controls is associated with analyzing business impacts. - When reviewing the phases of the risk management process, assessing the cost of deploying additional security controls is associated with identifying risk response versus analyzing business impacts.</i>

<b>08) Select the example that provides an accurate simulation of a company engaging in the identifying threats phase of risk management.</b>
    <i>A company conducts research to determine which vulnerabilities may be exploited. - The third phase of risk management is identify threats. Threats that may take advantage of, exploit, or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities. Threat refers to the sources or motivations of people and things that could cause loss or damage.</i>
    
<b>09) A company has 30 servers, each running for 125 hours before it needs maintenance. During this time, three servers fail. Rounding to the nearest whole number, calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for this scenario.</b>
    <i>1250 - The calculation for Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the total time divided by the number of total failures. In this scenario, the company has 30 servers that run for 125 hours (30x125), with the resulting product of 3,750. This result is then divided by the number of failures (3,750/3), which equals an MTBF of 1,250.</i>
