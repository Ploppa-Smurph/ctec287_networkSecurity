<h1>CTEC 287 Lesson 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure; Lesson 07: Implementing Authentication Controls</h1>


<h2>Quiz 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
   <b>01) What is the purpose of a web server certificate?</b>
       <i>A web server certificate guarantees the identity of the server that provides web services like a website or e-commerce sites. 
             The web serverâ€™s public certificate allows users to submit data securely to the web server.</i>
       
   <b>02) If not managed properly, certificate and key management can represent a critical vulnerability. Assess the following statements about key management and select the true statements. (Select all that apply.)</b>
       <i>A problem with key storage is the difficulty associated with multiple backups of a private key. It is exponentially more difficult to ensure the key is not compromised in this situation.

        If a key is not backed up, it represents a single point of failure. Key recovery is a process for backing up keys and/or recovering data encrypted with a lost key.</i>

<h3>Lab 07: Managing Life Cycle of a Certificate</h3>
Scenario: In this activity, you will explore the properties of different kinds of digital certificates and use Windows to request, issue, and revoke certificates.
<h3>Lab 08: Managing Certificates with OpenSSl</h3>
Scenario: In this activity, you will work with OpenSSL to manage certificates. You will generate certificates, generate a certificate signing request, and convert certificate formats. 
    - These are all tasks administrators are responsible for when managing web servers, email servers, and other devices.
<h3>Lab 09: Auditing Passwords with a Password Cracking Utility</h3>
Scenario: In this activity, you will view probable passwords based on a survey, integrate the passwords into a wordlist, and then use the modified wordlist to audit passwords by using John the Ripper. 
    - This activity is designed to test your understanding of and ability to apply content examples in the following 
    CompTIA Security+ objectives: 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack.
<h3>Lab 10: Managing Centralized Authentication</h3>    
Scenario: In this activity, you will register and configure a RADIUS client with an existing RADIUS server, configure a network policy, set role-based access, and then test access. 
    - This activity is designed to test your understanding of and ability to apply content examples in the following CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.8 Given a scenario, implement authentication and authorization solutions.
