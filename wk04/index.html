<h1>CTEC 287 Lesson 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure; Lesson 07: Implementing Authentication Controls</h1>


<h2>Quiz 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
   <b>01) What is the purpose of a web server certificate?</b>
       <i>A web server certificate guarantees the identity of the server that provides web services like a website or e-commerce sites. 
             The web server’s public certificate allows users to submit data securely to the web server.</i>
       
   <b>02) If not managed properly, certificate and key management can represent a critical vulnerability. Assess the following statements about key management and select the true statements. (Select all that apply.)</b>
       <i>A problem with key storage is the difficulty associated with multiple backups of a private key. It is exponentially more difficult to ensure the key is not compromised in this situation.

        If a key is not backed up, it represents a single point of failure. Key recovery is a process for backing up keys and/or recovering data encrypted with a lost key.</i>
   
   <b>03) An employee has requested a digital certificate for a user to access the Virtual Private Network (VPN). It is discovered that the certificate is also being used for digitally signing emails. 
           Evaluate the possible extension attributes to determine which should be modified so that the certificate only works for VPN access.</b>
       <i>Set the Extended Key Usage (EKU) field of a certificate to define its usage. Applications such as virtual private network (VPN) or email clients may require specific requirements for key usage configuration.</i>
   
   <b>04) An employee handles key management and has learned that a user has used the same key pair for encrypting documents and digitally signing emails. Prioritize all actions that should be taken and determine the first action that the employee should take.</b>
       <i>The first step is to recover any data encrypted with the key so the data can be decrypted. Once the data is recovered, the key can be revoked and an administrator can issue a new key pair.</i>
   
   <b>05) A company has a critical encryption key that has an M-of-N control configuration for protection. Examine the examples and select the one that correctly illustrates the proper configuration for this type of protection of critical encryption keys.</b>
       <i>A correct configuration for an M-of-N control is M=3 and N=5. M stands for the number of authorized administrators that must be present to access the critical encryption keys and N is the total number of authorized administrators. In this scenario, 3 of the 5 administrators must be present for access.</i>
   
   <b>06) Consider the life cycle of an encryption key. Which of the following is NOT a stage in a key's life cycle?</b>
       <i>Verification is not a stage in a key’s life cycle. It is part of the software development life cycle. 
        The stages are: key generation, certificate generation, storage, revocation, and expiration and renewal.</i>
   
   <b>07) Digital certificates are based on the X.509 standard that defines the fields (or information) about a subject (or entity using the certificate) and the certificate’s issuer. Which of the following fields would not be included in a standard public certificate?</b>
       <i>An endorsement key is not required for a digital certificate. It is part of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and used to create subkeys for key storage, signature, and encryption operations.</i>
   
   <b>08) A website with many subdomains has been issued a web server certificate for domain validation. This certificate verifies the parent domain and all subdomains (to a single level). This certificate is also known as which of the following?</b>
       <i>A wildcard certificate with a field entry of a wildcard domain such as *.comptia.org, means that the certificate issued to the parent domain will be accepted as valid for all subdomains (to a single level).</i>

   <b>09) An employee handling key management discovers that a private key has been compromised. Evaluate the stages of a key's life cycle and determine which stage the employee initiates upon learning of the compromise.</b>    
       <i>Upon learning of a compromise, the current key should be revoked, and a new key can then be generated.</i> 

   <b>10) A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) has a publish period set to 24 hours. Based on the normal procedures for a CRL, what is the most applicable validity period for this certificate?</b>    
       <i>One or two hours over the publish period is considered normal thus making 26 hours within the window.</i> 

   <b>11) A web administrator visits a website after installing its certificate to test the SSL binding. The administrator's client computer did not trust the website's certificate. The administrator views the website's certificate from the browser to determine which certificate authority (CA) generated the certificate. 
          Which certificate field would assist with the troubleshooting process?</b>    
       <i>The Issuer field provides the name of the certificate authority (CA) that generated and issued the certificate for the web server.</i> 

<h2>Quiz 07: Implementing Authentication Controls</h2> 
    <b>01) Analyze each scenario and determine which best describes the authentication process in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</b> 
        <i>Authentication proves that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access the resource. A CAC and pin login are examples of authentication.</i>     
    
    <b>02) Regarding the various tools of biometric authentication and their capabilities/limitations, which statement is accurate?</b> 
        <i>Regarding biometric authentication, Fingerprint scanning is the most widely implemented biometric authentication method.</i>     
    
    <b>03) Which of the following options represents Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</b> 
        <i>In Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), a user must possess two of the three authentication types of “something you know”, “something you have”, or “something you are”. 
            Using a password and a smart card would be 2FA since it combines “something you know” (password) with “something you have” (smart card).</i>     
    
    <b>04) Evaluate how identification and authentication are distinct in their functions. Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a user being authenticated?</b> 
        <i>A face scan is also known as biometrics, which is a "something you are" authentication. This is known as behavioral biometric recognition.</i>     
    
    <b>05) Biometric authentication methods have different error rates, with some methods being easier to fool than others. An unauthorized user is unlikely to fool which of the following methods?</b> 
        <i>Biometric authentication based on a retinal scan is the hardest method to fool. Retinal scanning is used to identify the patterns of blood vessels with the eye, whereas an iris scan only uses the surface of the eye.</i>     
    
    <b>06) A user presents a smart card to gain access to a building. Authentication is handled through integration to a Windows server that's acting as a certificate authority on the network. Review the security processes and conclude which are valid when using Kerberos authentication. (Select all that apply.)</b> 
        <i>Inputting a correct PIN authorizes the smart card's cryptoprocessor to use its private key to create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) request to an Authentication Server (AS).

            The AS can place trust when the user's certificate is issued by a local or third-party root certification authority.</i>     
    
    <b>07) Select the explanations that accurately describe the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) role within the Authentication Service (AS). (Select all that apply.)</b> 
        <i>The AS issues a TGT to the client after successful authentication, and it contains information about the client, including their name and IP address, along with a timestamp and validity period. The TGT is encrypted with the secret key of the Authentication Server (AS) to ensure its confidentiality and integrity during transmission and storage.
 
            The TGS issues service tickets to the client, and these tickets contain a session key that is shared between the client and the requested service. The TGT does not contain any service session key for use between the client and the application server.</i>     
    
    <b>08) A company receives a massive flood of requests which overloads the company's intranet and services. What type of attack is the company experiencing at this time?</b> 
        <i>Clogging a company's pipe in and out of the network would be considered a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The attacker can do this various ways, one example is to keep trying to connect to a device that is externally facing. A company can throttle connections to mitigate DoS attacks. </i>     
    
    <b>09) Analyze the features of behavioral technologies for authentication, and choose the statements that accurately depict this type of biometric authentication. (Select all that apply.)</b> 
        <i>Behavioral technologies are sometimes classified as "something you do." These technologies often have a lower cost to implement than other types of biometric cryptosystems, but they have a higher error rate.

            Typing is used as a behavioral technology, and the template is based on the speed and pattern of a user's input of a passphrase.</i>     
    
    <b>10) Consider biometric methods that are used to authenticate a user. Knowing that errors are possible, which of the following would most likely result in a security breach?</b> 
        <i>Regarding biometric authentication, a false positive is where an unauthorized person is accepted, leading to possible security breaches. This is the False Acceptance Rate (FAR).</i>     
    
    <b>11) A security team has just added iris scanners to two access control points in a secure facility. They are in the process of making adjustments to ensure authorized users have access, while unauthorized users cannot get through.
            Analyze the scenario and determine what metric the team is in the process of fine-tuning.</b> 
        <i>The process of fine-tuning a biometric system involves adjusting the crossover error rate, the point at which the false rejection rate and false acceptance rate meet.</i>     
    
    <b>12) Both Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+) provide authentication, authorization, and accounting using a separate server (the AAA server). Based on the protocols' authentication processes, select the true statements. (Select the best three choices.)</b> 
        <i>RADIUS uses UDP by default over ports 1812 and 1813 and TACACS+ uses TCP on port 49.


            TACACS+ encrypts the whole packet (except the header, which identifies the packet as TACACS+ data) and RADIUS only encrypts the password portion of the packet using MD5.
            
            
            RADIUS is primarily used for network access for a remote user and TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration. TACACS+ provides centralized control for administrators to manage routers, switches, and firewall appliances, as well as user privileges.</i>     
    
    <b>13) Based on the known facts of password attacks, critique the susceptibility of the password "DogHouse23" to an attack.</b> 
        <i>The password does not contain special characters, and also contains words that are found in the dictionary. Both of these attributes make the password vulnerable.</i>     
    
    <b>14) When a network uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) as the authentication method, what access control standard restricts local traffic to authentication data when a client connects over a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway?</b> 
        <i>The IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) standard provides the means of using an EAP method when a device connects to a VPN gateway. With 802.1X, the network access server (NAS) device accepting remote connections does not have to store any authentication credentials. The network access 
            server forwards only EAP authentication data between the authentication server (implemented by TACACS+ or RADIUS) and the supplicant requesting remote access. Full network access is only granted once the supplicant has been authenticated.</i>     
    
    <b>15) Analyze the types of password cracker attacks to determine which scenario best describes a brute force attack.</b> 
        <i>A brute force attack attempts every possible combination in the key space in order to derive a plaintext password from a hash. The key space is determined by the number of bits used.</i>     
    
    <b>16) Based on knowledge of the fundamentals of One-time Passwords (OTP), which of the following choices represents the problem that exists with HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) and is addressed by Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP)?</b> 
        <i>Tokens can persist unexpired in HOTP, increasing the risk of an attacker obtaining one and decrypting data in the future. TOTP addresses this by adding a value to the shared secret derived from the device’s and server’s local timestamp. TOTP automatically expires each token after a short window of time.</i>     
    
    <b>17) An Identity and Access Management (IAM) system has four main processes. Which of the following is NOT one of the main processes?</b> 
        <i>Integrity is the fundamental security goal of keeping organizational information accurate, free of errors, and without unauthorized modifications. However, it is not part of the IAM system. IAM defines the attributes that comprise an entity's identity. The four processes include Authorization, Accounting, Identification, and Authentication.</i>     
    
    <b>18) Evaluate the following controls that have been set by a system administrator for an online retailer. Determine which statement demonstrates the identification control within the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</b> 
        <i>Identification controls are set to ensure that customers are legitimate. An example is to ensure that billing and primary delivery addresses are real and valid.</i>     
    
    <b>19) Which of the following password cracker attacks are combined to create a typical hybrid password attack? (Select all that apply.)</b> 
        <i>A typical hybrid password attack uses a combination of dictionary and brute force attacks.

            A dictionary attack is a type of password attack that compares encrypted passwords against a predetermined list of possible password values. A brute force attack attempts every possible combination in the key space in order to derive a plaintext password from a hash.</i>
