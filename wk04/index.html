<h1>CTEC 287 Lesson 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure; Lesson 07: Implementing Authentication Controls</h1>


<h2>Quiz 06: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
   <b>01) What is the purpose of a web server certificate?</b>
       <i>A web server certificate guarantees the identity of the server that provides web services like a website or e-commerce sites. 
             The web server’s public certificate allows users to submit data securely to the web server.</i>
       
   <b>02) If not managed properly, certificate and key management can represent a critical vulnerability. Assess the following statements about key management and select the true statements. (Select all that apply.)</b>
       <i>A problem with key storage is the difficulty associated with multiple backups of a private key. It is exponentially more difficult to ensure the key is not compromised in this situation.

        If a key is not backed up, it represents a single point of failure. Key recovery is a process for backing up keys and/or recovering data encrypted with a lost key.</i>
   
   <b>03) An employee has requested a digital certificate for a user to access the Virtual Private Network (VPN). It is discovered that the certificate is also being used for digitally signing emails. 
           Evaluate the possible extension attributes to determine which should be modified so that the certificate only works for VPN access.</b>
       <i>Set the Extended Key Usage (EKU) field of a certificate to define its usage. Applications such as virtual private network (VPN) or email clients may require specific requirements for key usage configuration.</i>
   
   <b>04) An employee handles key management and has learned that a user has used the same key pair for encrypting documents and digitally signing emails. Prioritize all actions that should be taken and determine the first action that the employee should take.</b>
       <i>The first step is to recover any data encrypted with the key so the data can be decrypted. Once the data is recovered, the key can be revoked and an administrator can issue a new key pair.</i>
   
   <b>05) A company has a critical encryption key that has an M-of-N control configuration for protection. Examine the examples and select the one that correctly illustrates the proper configuration for this type of protection of critical encryption keys.</b>
       <i>A correct configuration for an M-of-N control is M=3 and N=5. M stands for the number of authorized administrators that must be present to access the critical encryption keys and N is the total number of authorized administrators. In this scenario, 3 of the 5 administrators must be present for access.</i>
   
   <b>06) Consider the life cycle of an encryption key. Which of the following is NOT a stage in a key's life cycle?</b>
       <i>Verification is not a stage in a key’s life cycle. It is part of the software development life cycle. 
        The stages are: key generation, certificate generation, storage, revocation, and expiration and renewal.</i>
   
   <b>07) Digital certificates are based on the X.509 standard that defines the fields (or information) about a subject (or entity using the certificate) and the certificate’s issuer. Which of the following fields would not be included in a standard public certificate?</b>
       <i>An endorsement key is not required for a digital certificate. It is part of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and used to create subkeys for key storage, signature, and encryption operations.</i>
   
   <b>08) A website with many subdomains has been issued a web server certificate for domain validation. This certificate verifies the parent domain and all subdomains (to a single level). This certificate is also known as which of the following?</b>
       <i>A wildcard certificate with a field entry of a wildcard domain such as *.comptia.org, means that the certificate issued to the parent domain will be accepted as valid for all subdomains (to a single level).</i>

   <b>09) An employee handling key management discovers that a private key has been compromised. Evaluate the stages of a key's life cycle and determine which stage the employee initiates upon learning of the compromise.</b>    
       <i>Upon learning of a compromise, the current key should be revoked, and a new key can then be generated.</i> 

   <b>10) A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) has a publish period set to 24 hours. Based on the normal procedures for a CRL, what is the most applicable validity period for this certificate?</b>    
       <i>One or two hours over the publish period is considered normal thus making 26 hours within the window.</i> 

   <b>11) A web administrator visits a website after installing its certificate to test the SSL binding. The administrator's client computer did not trust the website's certificate. The administrator views the website's certificate from the browser to determine which certificate authority (CA) generated the certificate. 
          Which certificate field would assist with the troubleshooting process?</b>    
       <i>The Issuer field provides the name of the certificate authority (CA) that generated and issued the certificate for the web server.</i> 

<h2>Quiz 07: Implementing Authentication Controls</h2> 
    <b>01) Analyze each scenario and determine which best describes the authentication process in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</b> 
        <i>Authentication proves that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access the resource. A CAC and pin login are examples of authentication.</i>     
    
    <b>02) Regarding the various tools of biometric authentication and their capabilities/limitations, which statement is accurate?</b> 
        <i>Regarding biometric authentication, Fingerprint scanning is the most widely implemented biometric authentication method.</i>     
    
    <b>03) Which of the following options represents Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</b> 
        <i>In Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), a user must possess two of the three authentication types of “something you know”, “something you have”, or “something you are”. 
            Using a password and a smart card would be 2FA since it combines “something you know” (password) with “something you have” (smart card).</i>     
    
    <b>04) Evaluate how identification and authentication are distinct in their functions. Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a user being authenticated?</b> 
        <i>A face scan is also known as biometrics, which is a "something you are" authentication. This is known as behavioral biometric recognition.</i>     
    
    <b>05) Biometric authentication methods have different error rates, with some methods being easier to fool than others. An unauthorized user is unlikely to fool which of the following methods?</b> 
        <i>Biometric authentication based on a retinal scan is the hardest method to fool. Retinal scanning is used to identify the patterns of blood vessels with the eye, whereas an iris scan only uses the surface of the eye.</i>     
    
    <b>06) </b> 
        <i></i>     
    
    <b>07) </b> 
        <i></i>     
    
    <b>08) </b> 
        <i></i>     
    
    <b>09) </b> 
        <i></i>     
    
    <b>10) </b> 
        <i></i>     
    
    <b>11) </b> 
        <i></i>
