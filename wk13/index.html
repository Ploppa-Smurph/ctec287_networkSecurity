<h2>Review Questions</h2>
<b>01) A project manager is developing a site layout for a new facility. Consider the principles of site layout design to recommend the best plan for the project.</b>
    <i>Minimize traffic passing between zones so that the flow of people are in and out, instead of across and between.
        - </i>

<b>02) A project manager has designed a new secure data center and has decided to use multifactor locks on each door to prevent unauthorized access. Compare the
       following types of locks that the project manager may use to determine which example the facility is utilizing.</b>
    <i>A lock that requires an employee to use a smart card and pin to enter.

        - A multifactor lock is one that may combine different methods to enter, such as a smart card with a PIN.</i>
    
<b>03) An organization plans the destruction of old HDDs. In an effort to save money, the organization decides that the technicians will hit the drives with hammers. 
       Which method is being used?</b>
    <i>Pulverizing - Pulverizing involves destroying media by impact. It is important to note that hitting a hard drive with a hammer can actually leave a surprising
         amount of recoverable data. Industrial machinery should perform this type of destruction.</i>
        
<b>04) The security team at an organization looks to protect highly confidential servers. Which method does the team propose when protecting the servers against explosives?</b>
    <i>vault - A vault is a room that is hardened against unauthorized entry by physical means, such as drilling or explosives.</i>

<b>05) Which of the following are appropriate methods of media sanitization? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>Use random data to overwrite data, Low-level format a hard disk to its factory condition, Dagauss a had drive using a machine with a powerful electromagnet.
        - There are several ways to perform media sanitization, defined as decommissioning various media, including hard drives, flash drives, and tape media. Data sanitization 
        can be performed by overwriting old data on each location on the media using either zeroes or a random pattern.

        - Low-level format can be used to reset a disk to its factory condition. Most disk vendors supply tools to reset a disk and is often described as low-level format tools. It will have the same type of effect as disk wiping software.
        
        - A magnetic disk can be mechanically shredded or degaussed, exposing the disk to a powerful electromagnet. The machine used to perform this action is costly and will render the disk unusable, meaning it cannot be repurposed or resold.</i>
<b>06) An engineer receives an alert from a mobile system equipped with an RFID tag. Upon investigating, the mobile system is missing from its assigned station. Which alarm type prompted the engineer to investigate?</b>
    <i>Proximity - A proximity alarm may use radio frequency ID (RFID) tags and readers that can track the movement of tagged objects within an area. This can form the basis of an alarm system to detect whether someone is trying to remove equipment.</i>

<b>07) Compare physical access controls with network security to identify the statements that accurately connect the similarities between them. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i> - Authentication provides users access through the barriers, while authorization determines the barriers around a resource.
        
        - An example of authentication in networking is a user logging into the network with a smart card. Similarly, authentication in physical security is demonstrated by an employee using a badge to enter a building.
        Authentication creates access lists and identification mechanisms to allow approved persons through the barriers.
        An example of authentication is a user who logs into a network with a smart card. In terms of physical security, authentication is represented by an employee using a badge to enter a building. </i>

<b>08) An organization plans the destruction of old flash drives. In an attempt to erase the media, an employee uses an electromagnet, only to discover that it did not destroy the data. Which method has the employee tried?</b>
    <i>Degaussing - Degaussing involves exposing a magnetic hard disk to a powerful electromagnet. This disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface. Degaussing cannot erase non-magnetic disks, such as flash drives.</i>
    
<b>09) A secure data center has multiple alarms installed for security. Compare the features of the types of alarms that may be installed, and determine which is an example of a circuit alarm.</b>
    <i>Windows and emergency exits along the perimeter will sound an alarm when opened.
        - Circuit alarms sound when the circuit is opened or closed. This could be caused by a door or window opening.</i>
