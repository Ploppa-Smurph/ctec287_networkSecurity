<h2>09 Review Questions</h2>
<b>01) An Internet Service Provider's (ISP) customer network is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The ISP decides to use a blackhole as a remedy. How does the ISP justify their decision?</b>
    <i>A blackhole drops packets for the affected IP addresses(es). A blackhole is an area of the network that cannot reach any other part of the network which protects the unaffected portion.

        A blackhole does make the attack less damaging to the other ISP customers but does not send legitimate traffic to the correct destination. The blackhole does not look at packets and simply drops all packets into the black hole.</i>
 
<b>02) A company is reviewing the options for installing a new wireless network. They have requested recommendations for utilizing WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Differentiate between Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Determine which of the following statements accurately distinguishes between the options. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>WPA2 uses an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption, while WPA and WEP use RC4. WPA combines the RC4 with a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), while WEP uses a 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV).

        WPA2 is the strongest encryption scheme due to the use of AES. WPA is stronger than WEP because of the TKIP. WEP uses the 24-bit IV, which has known vulnerabilities and is the weakest encryption system of the three.</i>
    
<b>03) A systems administrator is building a wireless network using WPA3 technology. Which of the following would NOT be considered a main feature of WPA3?</b>
    <i>Version 1 of WPA uses the RC4 stream cipher but adds a mechanism called the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to make it stronger.</i>
 
<b>04) An attacker tricks a host within a subnet into routing through an attacker's machine, rather than the legitimate default gateway, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Compare the types of routing vulnerabilities and conclude what the attacker is exploiting in this scenario.</b>    
    <i>ARP poisoning occurs by tricking hosts on the subnet into routing through the attacker's machine rather than the legitimate default gateway. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform replay or MitM attacks.</i>

<b>05) Compare the characteristics of a rogue Access Point (AP) in wireless networks to determine which statements correctly summarize their attributes. (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i>A rogue AP masquerading as a legitimate one is an evil twin. When users try to reconnect to an AP after being disconnected, user could connect to the evil twin unknowingly.

        An attacker can also form evil twins, giving the AP a similar name (SSID) to that of the legitimate AP. Users may select this AP by mistake, and enter their credentials, which the attacker will capture.
        
        Rogue APs can be setup with something as basic as a smartphone with tethering capabilities. It is vital to periodically survey the site to detect rogue APs.</i>
 
<b>06) During the planning/scoping phase of the kill chain, an attacker decides that a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack would be the best way to disrupt the target website and remain anonymous. Evaluate the following explanations to determine the reason the attacker chose a DDoS attack.</b>    
    <i>DDoS uses a botnet to launch the attack. Distributed means the attack launches from multiple, compromised computers and devices, which is a botnet. Since the attack will come from multiple IP addresses, it will mask the identity of the attacker.</i>

<b>07) Where should an administrator place an internet-facing host on the network?</b>
    <i>Internet-facing hosts reside in one or more Demilitarized Zones (DMZs), or perimeter networks. Traffic can not pass through a DMZ, but it enables external clients to access data on private systems, such as web servers, without compromising the security of the entire internal network.</i>
 
<b>08) There are several types of security zones on a network. Analyze network activities to determine which of the following does NOT represent a security zone.</b>    
    <i>A screened host is when a smaller network accesses the Internet using a dual-homed proxy/gateway servers.</i>

<b>09) A network manager suspects that a wireless network is undergoing a deauthentication attack. Applying knowledge of wireless network attacks, which scenario best supports the network manager's suspicion?</b>
    <i>A deauthentication attack, coupled with the use of a rogue AP, sends a stream of spoofed deauth frames to cause a client to deauthenticate from the AP. This may allow the attacker to interpose the rogue AP or to sniff information about the authentication process.</i>
 
<b>10) Given that layer 2 does not recognize Time to Live, evaluate the potential problems to determine which of the following options prevents this issue.</b>    
    <i>STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) is a switching protocol that prevents network loops by dynamically disabling links as needed. Since layer 2 protocol has no concept of Time To Live, layer 2 broadcast traffic could continue to loop through a network with multiple paths indefinitely.</i>

<b>11) Given knowledge of load balancing and clustering techniques, which configuration provides consistent performance and partial fault tolerance for applications like streaming audio and video services?</b>
    <i>In active/passive clustering, if the active node suffers a fault, the connection can failover to the passive node, without performance degradation.</i>
 
<b>12) A hotel guest opens their computer and logs into the Wi-Fi without prompting the guest for a username and password. Upon opening an internet browser, a splash page appears that requests the guest's room number and last name for authentication. Which type of authentication is the hotel utilizing?</b>    
    <i>Mostly used on a public access point, open authentication does not require the client to authenticate, as it sends data over the link unencrypted. When combined with a secondary authentication mechanism, a browser can manage open authentication. The secondary authentication redirects the client to a captive portal or a splash page.</i>

<b>13) Consider the types of zones within a network's topology and locate the zone considered semi-trusted and requires hosts to authenticate to join.</b>
    <i>An extranet zone is a network of semi-trusted hosts, typically representing business partners, suppliers, or customers. Hosts must authenticate to join the extranet.</i>
 
<b>14) Analyze the available detection techniques and determine which are useful in identifying a rogue system through software management. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>Intrusion detection and NAC are security suites and appliances that can combine automated network scanning with defense and remediation suites to prevent rogue devices from accessing the network.

        Wireless monitoring can reveal the presence of unauthorized or malicious access points and stations.</i>

<b>15) Evaluate the typical weaknesses found in network architecture and determine which statement best aligns with a security weakness.</b>
    <i>Overdependence on perimeter security occurs when the network architecture is flat. If an attacker can penetrate the network edge, the attacker will then have freedom of movement throughout the entire network.</i>
 
<b>16) Identify the attack that can launch by running software against the CAM table on the same switch as the target.</b>    
    <i>MAC flooding is a variation of an ARP poisoning attack. While ARP poisoning is directed at hosts, MAC flooding is used to attack a switch.</i>
 
<b>17) Evaluate the following choices based on their potential to lead to a network breach. Select the choice that is NOT a network architecture weakness.</b>    
    <i>It is good that not all the hosts can talk to each other. If any host can contact another host, an attacker can penetrate the network edge and gain freedom of movement.</i>

<b>18) Which statement best describes the difference between session affinity and session persistence?</b>
    <i>Session affinity is a layer 4 approach to handling user sessions. When a client establishes a session, it stays with the node that first accepted the request.</i>
 
<b>19) Which statement regarding attacks on media access control (MAC) addresses accurately pairs the method of protection and what type of attack it guards against? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>In MAC filtering, a switch will record the specified number of MACs allowed to connect to a port, but then drop any traffic from other MAC addresses.

        DHCP snooping inspects traffic arriving on access ports to ensure that a host is not trying to spoof its MAC address.</i>
