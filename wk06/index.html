<h2>09 Review Questions</h2>
<b>01) An Internet Service Provider's (ISP) customer network is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The ISP decides to use a blackhole as a remedy. How does the ISP justify their decision?</b>
    <i>A blackhole drops packets for the affected IP addresses(es). A blackhole is an area of the network that cannot reach any other part of the network which protects the unaffected portion.

        A blackhole does make the attack less damaging to the other ISP customers but does not send legitimate traffic to the correct destination. The blackhole does not look at packets and simply drops all packets into the black hole.</i>
 
<b>02) A company is reviewing the options for installing a new wireless network. They have requested recommendations for utilizing WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Differentiate between Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Determine which of the following statements accurately distinguishes between the options. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>WPA2 uses an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption, while WPA and WEP use RC4. WPA combines the RC4 with a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), while WEP uses a 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV).

        WPA2 is the strongest encryption scheme due to the use of AES. WPA is stronger than WEP because of the TKIP. WEP uses the 24-bit IV, which has known vulnerabilities and is the weakest encryption system of the three.</i>
    
<b>03) A systems administrator is building a wireless network using WPA3 technology. Which of the following would NOT be considered a main feature of WPA3?</b>
    <i>Version 1 of WPA uses the RC4 stream cipher but adds a mechanism called the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to make it stronger.</i>
 
<b>04) An attacker tricks a host within a subnet into routing through an attacker's machine, rather than the legitimate default gateway, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Compare the types of routing vulnerabilities and conclude what the attacker is exploiting in this scenario.</b>    
    <i>ARP poisoning occurs by tricking hosts on the subnet into routing through the attacker's machine rather than the legitimate default gateway. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communications and perform replay or MitM attacks.</i>

<b>05) Compare the characteristics of a rogue Access Point (AP) in wireless networks to determine which statements correctly summarize their attributes. (Select all that apply.)</b>
