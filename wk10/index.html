<h3>Lesson 15: Implementing Secure Cloud Solutions</h3>
    <b>01) When provisioning application services in network architecture, an engineer uses a microservices approach as a solution. Which principle best fits the engineer's implementation?</b>
        <i>Each program or tool should do one thing well - Microservice-based development uses a philosophy that each program or tool should do one thing well. Each microservice should be \
            capable of developing, testing, and deploying independently, and said to be highly decoupled, rather than just loosely decoupled.</i>

    <b>02) A company provides file sharing services of internal documents via a hosted private cloud deployment model. Which scenario accurately depicts this type of file sharing?</b>
        <i>A cloud hosted by a third party for the exclusive use of the organization. -A third party hosts a hosted private cloud deployment model for the exclusive use of the organization. 
            This service is more secure and provides guaranteed performance but is more costly than other options.  </i>    
    
    <b>03) A company has many employees that work from home. The employees obtain data and post data to a shared file they access through a link on the Internet. Consider the types of virtualization and conclude which the company is most likely utilizing.</b>
        <i>Cloud Computing - Cloud computing is a service that provides on-demand resources such as server instances, data storage, databases, or applications. The service is typically provided over the Internet. </i>

    <b>04) An organization plans a move of systems to the cloud. In order to identify and assign areas of risk, what legal contract outlines potential risks and responsibilities for all relevant parties?</b>
        <i>Service level agreement -  It is imperative to identify precisely which risks are transferring to the cloud, which risks the service provider is undertaking, and which risks remain with the organization. A service level agreement (SLA) outlines those risks and responsibilities.</i>

    <b>05) A security team suspects the unauthorized use of an application programming interface (API) to a private web-based service. Which metrics do the team analyze and compare to a baseline for response times and usage rates, while investigating suspected DDoS attacks? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Number of Requests; Latency -  The number of requests is a basic load metric that counts the number of requests per second or requests per minute. Depending on the service type, admin can set a baseline for typical usage.

            Latency is the time in milliseconds (ms) taken for the service to respond to an API call. This can be measured for specific services or as an aggregate value across all services.</i>

    <b>06) A large sales organization uses a cloud solution to store large amounts of data. One afternoon, the data becomes inaccessible due to an outage at a data center. Which replication service level is currently in use?</b>
        <i>Local - A local replication solution replicates data within a single data center in the region that created the storage account. If the data center experiences an outage, so do all of the replicated copies. </i>

    <b>07) A security professional is looking to harden systems at an industrial facility. In particular, the security specialist needs to secure an HVAC system that is part of an IoT network. Which areas does the specialist look to secure from data exfiltration exploits? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Fog node; Edge gateway - Fog nodes are data processing layers located close to edge gateways, helping in the prioritization of critical data transmission. These nodes are high-value targets for both denial of service and data exfiltration attacks.
 
            Edge gateways carry out some pre-processing of data to and from edge devices for prioritization and manage the connectivity for data transfer to and from the storage and processing networks. Edge gateways are prime targets for exploitation. </i>

    <b>08) A systems administrator deploys a cloud access security broker (CASB) solution for user access to cloud services. Evaluate the options and determine which solution may be configured at the network edge and without modifying a user's system.</b>
        <i>Reverse Proxy - A reverse proxy (positioned at the cloud network edge) directs traffic to cloud services if the contents of that traffic comply with policy. This does not require configuration of users' devices. </i>

    <b>09) An engineer uses an abstract model that represents network functionality. Using infrastructure as code to deploy and manage a network, how does the engineer make control decisions?</b>
        <i>By prioritizing and securing traffic through infrastructure as code. -  When using infrastructure as code to deploy and manage a network, an engineer can make control decisions by defining access controls and configuring rules and policies in the code to prioritize and secure network traffic.</i>

    <b>10) A company has recently started using a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Compare cloud service types to determine what is being deployed.</b>
        <i>The company has leased both software and infrastructure resources. -  Platform as a service (PaaS) provides resources somewhere between SaaS and IaaS. A typical PaaS solution would provide servers and storage network infrastructure (as per IaaS) but also provide a multi-tier web application/database platform on top.</i> 

    <b>11) A startup designs a new online service and uses a serverless approach for some business functions. With this approach, how does the startup accomplish these functions? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Containers; Orchestration - When an operation needs processing by using a container, the cloud spins up the container to run the code, performs the processing, and then destroys the container.
 
            Serverless architecture depends heavily on the concept of event-driven orchestration, with many services involved to facilitate operations.</i>

    <b>12) A technician creates an executive-level presentation on the various cloud service models after the organization announces it will be transitioning from on-site services to the cloud. Which characteristics are associated with Infrastructure as a Service? (Select the best two options.)</b>
        <i>Assist in provisioning resources, such as server, load balancers, and SAN componenets quickly - When working with the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud model, provisioning resources, such as servers, load balancers, and SAN components quickly.

            Additionally, the IaaS model allows businesses to rent resources on an “as-needed” basis versus paying for all the available programs and licenses needed for work requirements. </i>    

    <b>13) An engineer creates a new virtualized cloud server with no security settings. What actions are typically recommended to secure such a resource? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Ensure software and hosts are patched regularly; Configure Devices to support isolated communications. -  Virtual Machine (VM) software, hosts and guest Operating Systems (OS) should be patched on regular intervals. Regular patching provides fixes for identified vulnerabilities.

            Virtual networking devices should be configured to support isolated communications wherever necessary. This will allow communications with the necessary clients.</i>

    <b>14) A systems administrator configures several subnets within a virtual private cloud (VPC). The VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it, however, the subnets remain private. What does the administrator do to make the subnets accessible by the public?</b>
        <i>Configure a default route for each subnet. - The administrator must configure the Internet gateway as the default route for each public subnet. If the admin does not configure a default route, the subnet remains private, even if the VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it. </i>    

    <b>15) A developer considers using an API for service integration and automation. If choosing Representational State Transfer (REST) as the API, which features can the developer expect? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Ability to submit a request as an HTTP operation/verb; looser architectural framework. -  Requests sent as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) must be in a correctly formatted XML document. However, with Representational State Transfer (REST) requests, they can be submitted as an HTTP operation/verb (GET or POST for example).

            Representational State Transfer (REST) is a looser architectural framework, also referred to as RESTful APIs. SOAP is a tightly specified protocol.</i>
