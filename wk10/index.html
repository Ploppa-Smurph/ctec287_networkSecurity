<h3>Lesson 15: Implementing Secure Cloud Solutions</h3>
    <b>01) When provisioning application services in network architecture, an engineer uses a microservices approach as a solution. Which principle best fits the engineer's implementation?</b>
        <i>Each program or tool should do one thing well - Microservice-based development uses a philosophy that each program or tool should do one thing well. Each microservice should be \
            capable of developing, testing, and deploying independently, and said to be highly decoupled, rather than just loosely decoupled.</i>

    <b>02) A company provides file sharing services of internal documents via a hosted private cloud deployment model. Which scenario accurately depicts this type of file sharing?</b>
        <i>A cloud hosted by a third party for the exclusive use of the organization. -A third party hosts a hosted private cloud deployment model for the exclusive use of the organization. 
            This service is more secure and provides guaranteed performance but is more costly than other options.  </i>    
    
    <b>03) A company has many employees that work from home. The employees obtain data and post data to a shared file they access through a link on the Internet. Consider the types of virtualization and conclude which the company is most likely utilizing.</b>
        <i>Cloud Computing - Cloud computing is a service that provides on-demand resources such as server instances, data storage, databases, or applications. The service is typically provided over the Internet. </i>

    <b>04) An organization plans a move of systems to the cloud. In order to identify and assign areas of risk, what legal contract outlines potential risks and responsibilities for all relevant parties?</b>
        <i>Service level agreement -  It is imperative to identify precisely which risks are transferring to the cloud, which risks the service provider is undertaking, and which risks remain with the organization. A service level agreement (SLA) outlines those risks and responsibilities.</i>

    <b>05) A security team suspects the unauthorized use of an application programming interface (API) to a private web-based service. Which metrics do the team analyze and compare to a baseline for response times and usage rates, while investigating suspected DDoS attacks? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Number of Requests; Latency -  The number of requests is a basic load metric that counts the number of requests per second or requests per minute. Depending on the service type, admin can set a baseline for typical usage.

            Latency is the time in milliseconds (ms) taken for the service to respond to an API call. This can be measured for specific services or as an aggregate value across all services.</i>

    <b>06) A large sales organization uses a cloud solution to store large amounts of data. One afternoon, the data becomes inaccessible due to an outage at a data center. Which replication service level is currently in use?</b>
        <i>Local - A local replication solution replicates data within a single data center in the region that created the storage account. If the data center experiences an outage, so do all of the replicated copies. </i>

    <b>07) A security professional is looking to harden systems at an industrial facility. In particular, the security specialist needs to secure an HVAC system that is part of an IoT network. Which areas does the specialist look to secure from data exfiltration exploits? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Fog node; Edge gateway - Fog nodes are data processing layers located close to edge gateways, helping in the prioritization of critical data transmission. These nodes are high-value targets for both denial of service and data exfiltration attacks.
 
            Edge gateways carry out some pre-processing of data to and from edge devices for prioritization and manage the connectivity for data transfer to and from the storage and processing networks. Edge gateways are prime targets for exploitation. </i>

    <b>08) A systems administrator deploys a cloud access security broker (CASB) solution for user access to cloud services. Evaluate the options and determine which solution may be configured at the network edge and without modifying a user's system.</b>
        <i>Reverse Proxy - A reverse proxy (positioned at the cloud network edge) directs traffic to cloud services if the contents of that traffic comply with policy. This does not require configuration of users' devices. </i>

    <b>09) An engineer uses an abstract model that represents network functionality. Using infrastructure as code to deploy and manage a network, how does the engineer make control decisions?</b>
        <i>By prioritizing and securing traffic through infrastructure as code. -  When using infrastructure as code to deploy and manage a network, an engineer can make control decisions by defining access controls and configuring rules and policies in the code to prioritize and secure network traffic.</i>

    <b>10) A company has recently started using a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Compare cloud service types to determine what is being deployed.</b>
        <i>The company has leased both software and infrastructure resources. -  Platform as a service (PaaS) provides resources somewhere between SaaS and IaaS. A typical PaaS solution would provide servers and storage network infrastructure (as per IaaS) but also provide a multi-tier web application/database platform on top.</i> 

    <b>11) A startup designs a new online service and uses a serverless approach for some business functions. With this approach, how does the startup accomplish these functions? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Containers; Orchestration - When an operation needs processing by using a container, the cloud spins up the container to run the code, performs the processing, and then destroys the container.
 
            Serverless architecture depends heavily on the concept of event-driven orchestration, with many services involved to facilitate operations.</i>

    <b>12) A technician creates an executive-level presentation on the various cloud service models after the organization announces it will be transitioning from on-site services to the cloud. Which characteristics are associated with Infrastructure as a Service? (Select the best two options.)</b>
        <i>Assist in provisioning resources, such as server, load balancers, and SAN componenets quickly - When working with the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud model, provisioning resources, such as servers, load balancers, and SAN components quickly.

            Additionally, the IaaS model allows businesses to rent resources on an “as-needed” basis versus paying for all the available programs and licenses needed for work requirements. </i>    

    <b>13) An engineer creates a new virtualized cloud server with no security settings. What actions are typically recommended to secure such a resource? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Ensure software and hosts are patched regularly; Configure Devices to support isolated communications. -  Virtual Machine (VM) software, hosts and guest Operating Systems (OS) should be patched on regular intervals. Regular patching provides fixes for identified vulnerabilities.

            Virtual networking devices should be configured to support isolated communications wherever necessary. This will allow communications with the necessary clients.</i>

    <b>14) A systems administrator configures several subnets within a virtual private cloud (VPC). The VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it, however, the subnets remain private. What does the administrator do to make the subnets accessible by the public?</b>
        <i>Configure a default route for each subnet. - The administrator must configure the Internet gateway as the default route for each public subnet. If the admin does not configure a default route, the subnet remains private, even if the VPC has an Internet gateway attached to it. </i>    

    <b>15) A developer considers using an API for service integration and automation. If choosing Representational State Transfer (REST) as the API, which features can the developer expect? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Ability to submit a request as an HTTP operation/verb; looser architectural framework. -  Requests sent as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) must be in a correctly formatted XML document. However, with Representational State Transfer (REST) requests, they can be submitted as an HTTP operation/verb (GET or POST for example).

            Representational State Transfer (REST) is a looser architectural framework, also referred to as RESTful APIs. SOAP is a tightly specified protocol.</i>
<h3>Lesson 16: Explain Privacy and Data Protection Concepts</h3>
    <b>01) Analyze and determine the role responsible for managing the system where data assets are stored, and is responsible for enforcing access control, encryption, and backup measures.</b>
        <i>Data Custodian - A data custodian is responsible for managing the system where data assets are stored, including responsibility for enforcing access control, encryption, and backup or recovery measures.</i>
        
    <b>02) Data exists in several states, each requiring different security considerations. Evaluate the following items and select which data state presents the greatest risk due to decryption.</b>
        <i>Data in use -  Data in use is when data is present in volatile memory. When a user works with data, that data needs to be decrypted, which puts it at risk.</i>
      
    <b>03) A document contains information about a company that is too valuable to permit any risks, and viewing is severely restricted. Analyze levels of classification and determine the appropriate classification for the document.</b>
        <i>Critical -  Documents labeled as critical contain information that is too valuable to permit any risk of its capture, and viewing is severely restricted.</i>
            
    <b>04) A tech company is looking to secure data in a specific state. The state is 'in transit', meaning the data is being transmitted over a network. What data protection mechanism is most suitable for this data state?</b>
        <i>TLS (Transport Layer Security) or IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) - TLS or IPSec protocols help protect data as it moves across networks, ensuring that it remains confidential and hasn't been tampered with during transmission.</i>
      
    <b>05) Choose which of the following items classify as direct Personally Identifiable Information. (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Full Name; Date of Birth -  A full name can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. A full name is an identifier and can be used to search for a person to locate more PII that can be used to contact or locate a person.

            A date of birth can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. This information is often used when verifying identity and may be used by an attacker to obtain unauthorized access into accounts and obtain other PII.</i>
        
    <b>06) A company utilizing formal data governance assigns the role of data steward to an employee. Evaluate the roles within data governance and conclude which tasks the employee in this role performs.</b>
        <i>The employee ensures data is labeled and identified with appropriate metadata. - The data steward is primarily responsible for data quality. This involves tasks such as ensuring data is labeled and identified with appropriate
             metadata, and data is collected and stored in a format with values that comply with applicable laws and regulations. </i>
      
    <b>07) An organization suspects that a visitor is performing data exfiltration while on the premises. The organization knows that the visitor does not have any type of access to computer systems. Which of the following methods does the organization suspect the visitor of using? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Phone; Camera - Data exfiltration can happen by communicating information orally over a telephone, cell phone, or Voice over IP (VoIP) network. Cell phone text messaging is another possibility.
            
            A camera can capture images or video of data. This data may be computer data. Since the visitor has no access to computer systems, other targets may be paper documents, post-it notes on desks, building layouts, and more.</i>
        
    <b>08) A network manager assists with developing a policy to protect the company from data exfiltration. The employee devises a list of focus points to include. Which plans, when consolidated, provide the best protection for the company? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Creating a training program for all employees that reiterates the importance of knowing how to use encryption to secure data.;
            Only allow removable media if it is company property, if it is required to perform a task, and if it has been cleared through; the proper channels
            Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and disconnect systems that are storing archived data from the network - 
        
            Employees need training in document confidentiality and how to use encryption to store and transmit data securely. Annual refresher training will remind employees of its importance.

            One mechanism for data exfiltration is by copying data to removable media or other device storage, such as USB drives or memory cards. Limiting the use of these to company property and only for job-related tasks helps reduce this risk.
            
            Always encrypt sensitive data at rest. Transferring data outside of the network will likely be useless without the decryption key.</i>
      
    <b>09) Analyze the features of Microsoft's Information Rights Management (IRM) and choose the scenarios that accurately depict IRM. (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>File Permissions are assigned based on the roles within a document;
            A document is emailed as an attachment, but cannot be printed by the receiver;
            An email message cannot be forwarded to another employee. - 
            
            A benefit of IRM is that file permissions can be assigned for different document roles, such as author, editor, or reviewer. Each role can have specific access such as sending, printing, and editing.

            Printing and forwarding of documents can be restricted even when the document is sent as a file attachment. This means that just because a document is forwarded it may not have printing capabilities.

            Printing and forwarding of email messages can be restricted.</i>
        
    <b>10) A new cloud-based application will replicate its data on a global scale, but will exclude residents of the European Union. Which concerns should the organization that provides the data to consumers take into consideration? (Select all that apply.)</b>
        <i>Sovereignty; Data Location -  Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems that do not physically reside within that jurisdiction.

            Storage locations might have to be carefully selected to mitigate data sovereignty issues. Most cloud providers allow a choice of data centers for processing and storage.</i>
