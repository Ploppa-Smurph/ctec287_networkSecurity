<h3>08 Labs</h3>
<h4>Lab 11 - Managing Access Controls in Windows Server</h4>
        In this activity, you will explore the use of different kinds of accounts for managing objects in Active Directory and the use of GPO to apply account policies. 
         CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.7 Given a scenario, implement identity and account management controls.
<h4>Lab 12 - Configuring a System for Auditing Policies</h4>
        In this activity, you will display processes running on the server, confirm applied Group Policy Objects, and then use Group Policy Objects to configure auditing.
<h4>Lab 13 - Managing Access Controls in Linux</h4>
        In this activity, you will manage access controls on a Linux server. First, you will configure local users and groups on the system. Next, you will create directories and files to represent resources that need to be controlled. Next, you will configure the ownership of these directories and files. Finally, you'll configure standard Linux permissions to manage for the users and groups to access the directories and files.
          CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.8 Given a scenario, implement authentication and authorization solutions. 4.1 Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool to assess organizational security. 
<h4>Lab 14 - </h4>
<h2>Review 08 Implementing Identity and Account Management Control</h2>
<b>1) A network administrator regularly reviews group membership and access control lists for each resource. The administrator also looks for unnecessary accounts to disable. What is the administrator executing in this situation?</b>
    <i>The administrator is permission auditing, involving the regular review of privileges such as group membership, access control lists for each resource plus identifying, and disabling unnecessary accounts.</i>

<b>2) Which type of employee training utilizes gaming and/or scenario-based techniques to emphasize training objectives? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>Capture the Flag (CTF) is usually used in ethical hacker training programs and gamified competitions. Participants complete a series of challenges within a virtualized computing environment to discover a flag that represents a vulnerability or attack to overcome.


        Computer-based training (CBT) allows a student to acquire skills and experience by completing practical simulations or branching choice scenarios. CBT might use video game elements to improve engagement.</i>

<b>3) Many Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, allow users to share a single set of credentials between multiple services providers. For example, a user could login to Amazon using their Facebook credentials. Which term correctly defines this example?</b>    
    <i>Federation means the company trusts the accounts created and managed by a different network. The networks establish trust relationships, so the identity of a user (principal) from network A (identity provider), can be trusted as authentic by network B (service provider).</i>

<b>4) A Windows systems administrator needs to grant the users in the finance department with read-only access to a folder named 'Invoices.' What would be the proper and most manageable way to go about granting this access?</b>    
    <i>Adding the security group 'Finance' with 'Read' permissions to the Invoice folder will allow any user that is added to the Finance group to access the folder with the proper read-only permissions.</i>

<b>5) Examine the tradeoff between traditional password policy complexity requirements and updated practical suggestions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and select the statement that fits both practical password management and traditional complexity requirements.</b>    
    <i>Traditional password complexity rules (that is, no use of username within password and combination of at least eight upper/lower case alpha-numeric and non-alpha-numeric characters) often result in users writing down passwords. NIST recommends only blocking common passwords, such as dictionary words, repetitive strings (like 12345678), and contextual information.</i>

<b>6) A company's clean desk policy will most likely feature which of the following clauses?</b>    
    <i>A clean desk policy means that each employee's work area should be free from any documents left there. The policy aims to prevent sensitive information from being obtained by unauthorized staff or guests at the workplace.</i>

<b>7) A cyber team is tasked with reviewing the organization’s end-user policies for employees after critical information was found on a public GitHub repository. What conduct policy protects the organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing company assets?</b>    
    <i>Enforcing an acceptable use policy (AUP) is important to protect the organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment.</i>

<b>8) Windows has several service account types, typically used to run processes and background services. Which of the following statements about service accounts is FALSE?</b>    
    <i>The System account, not the Local Service account, creates the host processes that start Windows before the user logs on.</i>

<b>9) Analyze and compare the access control models in terms of how Access Control Lists (ACL) are written and determine which statement accurately explains the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model.</b>    
    <i>In DAC, the owner has full control over the resource, meaning that he or she can modify its ACL to grant rights to others. DAC is the most flexible and weakest control model.

        With DAC, decision-making lies with the resource owner. In rule-based access control (RBAC) and mandatory access control (MAC), it lies with the system owner (that is, the controls are enforced system-wide and cannot be countermanded or accepted by users "within" the system).
        
        DAC is the easiest model to compromise, as it is vulnerable to insider threats and abuse of compromised accounts.</i>

<b>10) Which statement best describes the purpose of an acceptable use policy (AUP)?</b>    
    <i>An AUP governs employees' use of company equipment and Internet services. AUPs protect an organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment.</i>

<b>11) Which of the following methods allows subjects to determine who has access to their objects?</b>    
    <i>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is not rule-based. DAC stresses the importance of the owner, who has full control over resources and can modify the Access Control List to grant rights to others.</i>

<b>12) Consider the challenges with providing privileged management and authorization on an enterprise network. Which of the following would the network system administrator NOT be concerned with when configuring directory services?</b>    
    <i>Denial of Service (DoS) is a network-based attack that consumes the network's bandwidth that could impact a directory service, but is more of a network concern than when managing a directory service.</i>

<b>13) An employee recently retired, and the employee received an exit interview, returned a company-issued laptop, and had company-specific programs and applications removed from a personal PC. Evaluate this employee’s offboarding process and determine what, if anything, remains to be done.</b>    
    <i>An exit interview (or offboarding) is the process of ensuring that an employee leaves a company gracefully, and that company assets remain secure.

        When an employee leaves, proper account management involves disabling the user’s account and privileges.</i>

<b>14) An employee arrives to office space, logs in to the company network, and uses a yubikey to authenticate. Upon authenticating, the employee can move within approved applications throughout the day without requiring additional authentication. What policy is best illustrated by this scenario?</b>    
    <i>This company is using a Single Sign-On (SSO) policy. This means that a user only has to authenticate to a system once, to gain access to all the resources to which the system has granted rights to the user. An example is when a user authenticates with Windows, and also authenticates with the Windows domain's SQL Server, and Exchange Server services.</i>

<b>15) A senior administrator is teaching a new technician how to properly develop a standard naming convention in Active Directory (AD). Examine the following responses and determine which statements are sound advice for completing this task. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>Organizational Units (OUs) represent administrative boundaries. They allow the enterprise administrator to delegate administrative responsibility for users and resources in different locations or departments. An OU grouped by location will be sufficient if different IT departments are responsible for services in different geographic locations. An OU grouped by department is more applicable if different IT departments are responsible for supporting different business functions.

        Within each root-level parent OU, use separate child OUs for different types of objects such as servers, client systems, users and groups. Be consistent.</i>

<b>16) Consider the role trust plays in federated identity management and determine which models rely on networks to establish trust relationships. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an identity federation format used to exchange authentication information between the principal, the service provider, and the identity provider.

        Authentication and authorization for a RESTful API is often implemented using the Open Authorization (OAuth) protocol.
        
        OpenID is an identity federation method enabling users authentication on cooperating websites by a third-party authentication service.</i>

<b>17) A member of the IT team at a company launches a simulated phishing attack email to users across the organization. Which of these statements most accurately describes the purpose of such an attack?</b>    
    <i>Untrained users represeIf admin detects or suspects an account misuse, they can manually disable the account, preventing the account from being used for login. A remote logoff command can end a session in progress.

        Smart cards or USB keys can store a user's certificate and private key, which can authenticate to different PCs and mobile devices. A stolen laptop and key represent a vulnerability.nt a serious vulnerability because they are susceptible to social engineering and malware attacks, such as phishing attempts.</i>

<b>18) Analyze the following scenarios and determine which cases call for account disablement over account lockout. (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i></i>

<b>19) A system administrator has configured a security log to record unexpected behavior and review the logs for suspicious activity. Consider various types of audits to determine which type aligns with this activity.</b>    
    <i>Usage auditing refers to configuring the security log to record key indicators and then reviewing the logs for suspicious activity. Behavior recorded by event logs that differs from expected behavior may indicate everything from a minor security infraction to a major incident.</i>

<b>20) An employee is working on a team to build a directory of systems they are installing in a classroom. The team is using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to update the X.500 directory. Utilizing the standards of an X.500 directory, which of the following distinguished names is the employee most likely to recommend?</b>    
    <i>A distinguished name is a unique identifier for any given resource within an X.500-like directory and made up of attribute=value pairs, separated by commas. The most specific attribute lists first, and then successive attributes become progressively broader.

        Also referred to as the relative distinguished name, the most specific attribute (in this case, system1) uniquely identifies the object within the context of successive attribute values.
        
        The directory schema describes the types of attributes, what information they contain, and the way attributes define object types. Some of the attributes commonly used include Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU), Organization (O), Country (C), and Domain Component (DC).
        
        In this scenario, CN=system1 is the Common Name, CN=User is the broader common name, OU=Univ is the Organizational Unit, and DC=local is the Domain Component. This goes in order of a specific system to the broadest Domain Component.</i>
