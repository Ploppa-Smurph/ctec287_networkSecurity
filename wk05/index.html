<h4>Lab 11 - Managing Access Controls in Windows Server</h4>
        In this activity, you will explore the use of different kinds of accounts for managing objects in Active Directory and the use of GPO to apply account policies. 
         CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.7 Given a scenario, implement identity and account management controls.
<h4>Lab 12 - Configuring a System for Auditing Policies</h4>
        In this activity, you will display processes running on the server, confirm applied Group Policy Objects, and then use Group Policy Objects to configure auditing.
<h4>Lab 13 - Managing Access Controls in Linux</h4>
        In this activity, you will manage access controls on a Linux server. First, you will configure local users and groups on the system.

Finally, you'll configure standard Linux permissions to manage for the users and groups to access the directories and files.
          CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.8 Given a scenario, implement authentication and authorization solutions. 4.1 Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool to assess organizational security.
