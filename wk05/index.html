<h1>CTEC 287 Lesson 08: Implementing Identity and Account Management Control </h1>
<h2>08.1</h2>
<h2>08.2</h2>
<h2>08.3</h2>
<h3>08 Labs</h3>
<h4>Lab 11 - Managing Access Controls in Windows Server</h4>
        In this activity, you will explore the use of different kinds of accounts for managing objects in Active Directory and the use of GPO to apply account policies. 
         CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.7 Given a scenario, implement identity and account management controls.
<h4>Lab 12 - Configuring a System for Auditing Policies</h4>
        In this activity, you will display processes running on the server, confirm applied Group Policy Objects, and then use Group Policy Objects to configure auditing.
<h4>Lab 13 - Managing Access Controls in Linux</h4>
        In this activity, you will manage access controls on a Linux server. First, you will configure local users and groups on the system. Next, you will create directories and files to represent resources that need to be controlled. Next, you will configure the ownership of these directories and files. Finally, you'll configure standard Linux permissions to manage for the users and groups to access the directories and files.
          CompTIA Security+ objectives: 3.8 Given a scenario, implement authentication and authorization solutions. 4.1 Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool to assess organizational security.

<h2>Review 08 Implementing Identity and Account Management Control</h2>
<b>1) A network administrator regularly reviews group membership and access control lists for each resource. The administrator also looks for unnecessary accounts to disable. What is the administrator executing in this situation?</b>
    <i>The administrator is permission auditing, involving the regular review of privileges such as group membership, access control lists for each resource plus identifying, and disabling unnecessary accounts.</i>

<b>2) Which type of employee training utilizes gaming and/or scenario-based techniques to emphasize training objectives? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i>Capture the Flag (CTF) is usually used in ethical hacker training programs and gamified competitions. Participants complete a series of challenges within a virtualized computing environment to discover a flag that represents a vulnerability or attack to overcome.


        Computer-based training (CBT) allows a student to acquire skills and experience by completing practical simulations or branching choice scenarios. CBT might use video game elements to improve engagement.</i>

<b>3) Many Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, allow users to share a single set of credentials between multiple services providers. For example, a user could login to Amazon using their Facebook credentials. Which term correctly defines this example?</b>    
    <i>Federation means the company trusts the accounts created and managed by a different network. The networks establish trust relationships, so the identity of a user (principal) from network A (identity provider), can be trusted as authentic by network B (service provider).</i>

<b>4) A Windows systems administrator needs to grant the users in the finance department with read-only access to a folder named 'Invoices.' What would be the proper and most manageable way to go about granting this access?</b>    
    <i>Adding the security group 'Finance' with 'Read' permissions to the Invoice folder will allow any user that is added to the Finance group to access the folder with the proper read-only permissions.</i>

<b>5) Examine the tradeoff between traditional password policy complexity requirements and updated practical suggestions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and select the statement that fits both practical password management and traditional complexity requirements.</b>    
    <i>Traditional password complexity rules (that is, no use of username within password and combination of at least eight upper/lower case alpha-numeric and non-alpha-numeric characters) often result in users writing down passwords. NIST recommends only blocking common passwords, such as dictionary words, repetitive strings (like 12345678), and contextual information.</i>

<b>6) A company's clean desk policy will most likely feature which of the following clauses?</b>    
    <i>A clean desk policy means that each employee's work area should be free from any documents left there. The policy aims to prevent sensitive information from being obtained by unauthorized staff or guests at the workplace.</i>
