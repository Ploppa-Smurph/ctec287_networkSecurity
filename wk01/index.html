<h2>Lesson 01 Practice Quiz</h2>
    <b>01) How might the goals of basic network management not align with the goals of security?</b>
    <i><b>Management focuses on availability over confidentiality.</b>

        Security is increasingly thought of as a dedicated function. The goals of a network manager are not always well-aligned with the goals of security; network management focuses on availability over confidentiality.
        
        System security may be a dedicated business unit with its own management structure. As a result, network management might only concern itself with availability.
        
        The goals of a basic network management are not always well-aligned with the goals of security; network management would not focus on confidentiality, but rather availability.
        
        Network management would encompass the responsibility for systems up-time and availability. Security administrators would focus on integrity and confidentiality.</i>

    <b>02) After a poorly handled security breach, a company updates its security policy to include an improved incident response plan. Which of the following security controls does this update address?</b>
    <i><b>Corrective</b>
        An incident response plan is corrective. It responds to and fixes an incident. It may also prevent its recurrence.

        Compensating is a security control that serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard.

        A deterrent is the control that may not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion.

        A detective is the control that may not prevent or deter access but will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion.  </i>

    <b>3) Which of the following has a cyber security framework (CSF) that focuses exclusively on IT security, rather than IT service provisioning?</b>
    <i><b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b>
        The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a relatively new addition to the IT governance space, and is distinct from other frameworks by focusing exclusively on IT security, rather than IT service provision more generally.

        ISO develops standards and frameworks governing the use of computers, networks, and telecommunications, including ones for information security (27000 series). It is a commercial product.
        
        COBIT is an IT governance framework with security as a core component. COBIT is published by ISACA and is also a commercial product, available through APMG International.
        
        SABSA is a methodology for providing information assurance aligned to business needs and driven by risk analysis.</i>
    
    <b>4) The _____ requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information.</b>
    <i><b>Computer Security Act</b>
        The Computer Security Act (1987) specifically requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information.


        The Federal Information Security Management Act (2002) governs the security of data processed by federal government agencies. This act requires agencies to implement an information security program.


        The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999) is a United States federal law that requires financial institutions to explain how they share and protect their customers' private information.


        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) mandates the implementation of risk assessments, internal controls and audit procedures. This act is not for any specific entity.     </i>
    
    <b>5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a framework that classifies security-related functions. Which description aligns with the "respond" function?</b>
    <i><b>Identify, Analyze, Contain, and Eradicate</b>
        The respond function is to identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.


        The identify function is to develop security policies and capabilities. This function is used to evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.


        The detect function is to perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.


        The recover function is to implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
    </i>    
    
    <b>6) An engineer looks to implement security measures by following the five functions in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. When documenting the “detect” function, what does the engineer focus on?</b>
    <i><b>Ongoing proactive monitoring</b>
        Detect refers to performing ongoing proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.

        Identify covers developing security policies and capabilities, and evaluating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.

        Protect and procure covers the processes to install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of an operations life cycle.

        Recovery deals with the implementation of cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
    </i>
    
    <b>7) A company has an annual contract with an outside firm to perform a security audit on their network. The purpose of the annual audit is to determine if the company is in compliance with their internal directives and policies for security control. 
       Select the broad class of security control that accurately demonstrates the purpose of the audit.</b>
    <i><b>Managerial</b>
        Managerial is the control that gives oversight of the information system including selection of other security controls. An example of this type of control is regular scans and audits.

        Technical control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.

        Physical controls deter access to premises and hardware. Examples include alarms, gateways, and locks.

        A compensating control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.
    </i>
    
    <b>8) Which security related phrase relates to the integrity of data?</b>
    <i><b>Modification</b> 
        Any modification is authorized and is stored and transferred as intended when referring to the integrity of data. Integrity is part of the CIA triad.

        Availability means that any information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. Availability is part of the CIA triad.

        Confidentiality means that certain information should only be known to certain people. Confidentiality is part of the CIA triad.

        Risk is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.
    </i>

    <b>9) Any external responsibility for an organization’s security lies mainly with which individuals?</b>
    <i><b>the Senior Executives</b>
    </i>External responsibility for security (due care or liability) lies mainly with owners or senior executives. It is important to note that all employees share some measure of responsibility.

        Technical and specialist staff have the direct responsibility for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring the policy. Security might be made a core competency of systems and network administrators, or there may be dedicated security administrators.
    
        Managers at an organization may have responsibility for a specific domain or unit, such as building control, ICT, or accounting.
    
        Non-technical staff have the responsibility of complying with policy and with any relevant legislation. Public relations is responsible for media communications.

    <b>10) The IT department head returns from an industry conference feeling inspired by a presentation on the topic of cybersecurity frameworks. A meeting is scheduled with IT staff to brainstorm ideas for deploying security controls by category and function throughout the organization. Which of the following ideas are consistent with industry definitions? (Select all that apply.)</b>    
    <i><b>A, C, D</b>
    </i>A technical control is enforced by computer hardware and software, such as an access control list (ACL) configured on a network firewall.

        Monitoring of risk and compliance is a type of managerial control, not an operational control. Operational controls are categorized as those performed by people, such as security guards.
    
        A preventive control such as user education and training is one that eliminates or reduces the likelihood of an attack before it can take place.
    
        A corrective control such as backup is used following an attack to eliminate or mitigate its impact.

<h2>Lesson 02 Practice Quiz</h2>
    <b>1) An IT manager in the aviation sector checks the industry's threat intelligence feed to keep up on the latest threats and ensure the work center implements the best practices in the field. What type of threat intelligence source is the IT manager most likely accessing?</b>
    <i><b>Information Sharing Analysis Center (ISACs)</b>
        ISACs are set up to share industry-specific threat intelligence and best practices in critical sectors, such as the aviation industry.

        OSINT includes any publicly available intelligence, in addition to threat intelligence services companies operate on an open source basis.
        
        Vendors often post proprietary intelligence on their websites and blogs, free of cost, as a general benefit to their consumers.
        
        Proprietary or closed threat intelligence platforms operate on a paid subscription basis. The security solution provider will also make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers in the form of blogs, white papers, and webinars.
    </i>

    <b>2) An unknowing user with authorized access to systems in a software development firm installs a seemingly harmless, yet unauthorized program on a workstation without the IT department's sanction. Identify the type of threat that is a result of this user's action.</b>
    <i><b>Unintentional Inside Threat</b>
        Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. Installing unauthorized software is negligent, but the user is an unintentional attack vector.

        A malicious insider intentionally exceeds or misuses his or her access for purposes of sabotage, financial gain, or business advancement.

        An attack vector is the path through which a threat actor gains access to a secure system; in this case, the path is through an employee's negligent software installation, which in all likelihood is not intentional.

        An external threat with insider knowledge usually refers to former insiders, such as ex-employees now working at another company or who have been dismissed and now harbor a grievance. This is not the case with this situation.
    </i>

    <b>3) </b>
    <i><b>Former Employee, Contractor</b>
        Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. In this example, a former employee and a contractor fit the criteria.

        Current employees, business partners, and contractors also qualify as insider threats.

        A hacktivist group, such as Anonymous, WikiLeaks, or LulzSec, uses cyber weapons to promote a political agenda.

        A white hat hacker is given complete access to information about the network, which is useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat, but they are not an insider threat.
    </i>

    <b>4) What is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)?</b>
    <i><b>Using Web searches to get public information</b>
        OSINT is using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. It requires almost no privileged access as it relies on finding information that the company makes publicly available, whether intentionally or not.

        Obtaining information, physical access to premises, or access to a user account through the art of persuasion is social engineering.

        The means the organization will take to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of sensitive data and resources is considered a security policy.

        Using software tools to obtain information about a host or network topology is considered scanning.
    </i>

    <b>5) A security engineer is investigating a potential system breach. When compiling a report of the incident, how does the engineer classify the actor and the vector?</b>
    <i><b>Threat</b>
        A threat is the potential for something to exploit a vulnerability. The thing that poses the threat is called an actor, while the path used can be referred to as the vector.

        A vulnerability is a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.

        Risk is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.

        An exploit is a method that is used to expose and compromise a vulnerability. 
    </i>

    <b>6) A Department of Defense (DoD) security team identifies a data breach in progress, based on some anomalous log entries, and take steps to remedy the breach and harden their systems. When they resolve the breach, they want to publish the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) securely, using standardized language for other government agencies to use. The team will transmit threat data feed via which protocol?</b>
    <i><b>Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)</b>
        The TAXII protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. Subscribers to the CTI service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII.

        While STIX provides the syntax for describing CTI, the TAXII protocol transmits CTI data between servers and clients.

        The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is especially aimed at Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), but private companies can join too. AIS is based on the STIX and TAXII standards and protocols.

        A file/code repository holds signatures of known malware code.
    </i>

    <b>7) A contractor has been hired to conduct security reconnaissance on a company. The contractor browses the company's website to identify employees and then finds their Facebook pages. Posts found on Facebook indicate a favorite bar that employees frequently visit. The contractor visits the bar and learns details of the company's security infrastructure through small talk. What reconnaissance phase techniques does the contractor practice? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i><b>OSINT and Social Engineering</b>
        OSINT refers to using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. The contractor used this technique by identifying employees and the local restaurant they go to after work.

        Social engineering was used at the restaurant by learning about the vacant positions and the shortfall in information security. This could be successful due to the attacker being charismatic and also social norms of people wanting to be friendly. The scenario also mentioned it was the popular location for after work drinks, meaning that alcohol was also likely involved.

        Scanning would be conducted if the contractor used software tools to obtain the information.

        Persistence refers to the tester's ability to reconnect to a compromised host.
    </i>

    <b>8) A system analyst is tasked with searching the dark web for harvested customer data. Because these sites cannot be readily found in standard website searches, what is often gained by "word of mouth" bulletin boards to assist in reaching the desired page?</b>
    <i><b>Dark Website URL</b>
    </i>Access to deep web sites, especially those hidden from search engines, are accessed via the website's URL. These are often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.


        The Onion Router (TOR) is software used to establish a network overlay to the Internet infrastructure to create the dark net. TOR, along with other software like Freenet or I2P, anonymizes the usage of the dark net.
    
    
        A dark web search engine can be used to find dark web website collections, which constitute roughly 1% of the deep web. Some dark web websites have hidden IP addresses and cannot be found by search engines or require additional software to gain access to the site.
    
    
        Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is cybersecurity-relevant information harvested from public websites and data records.
    <b>9) One aspect of threat modeling is to identify potential threat actors and the risks associated with each one. When assessing the risk that any one type of threat actor poses to an organization, what are the most critical factors to profile? (Select all that apply.)</b>
    <i><b>Intent, Motivation</b>
        From the choices provided, the two most critical factors to profile for a threat actor are intent and motivation. Greed, curiosity, or grievance may motivate an attacker.

        The intent could be to vandalize and disrupt a system or to steal something.
        
        While education and socioeconomic traits could potentially be considered in a threat actor profile, they are inferior to intent and motivation.
        
        Malicious intents and motivations can be contrasted with accidental or unintentional threat actors and agents. Unintentional threat actors represent accidents, oversights, and other mistakes. In this sense, training is crucial to ensuring employees are educated about security measures.</i>

    <b>10) A company technician goes on vacation. While the technician is away, a critical patch released for Windows servers is not applied. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), what does the delay in applying the patch create on the server?</b>
    <i><b>Vulnerability</b>
        NIST defines vulnerability as a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach. In addition to delays in applying patches, other examples of vulnerabilities include improperly installed hardware, untested software, and inadequate physical security.


        Control is a system or procedure put in place to mitigate a risk. An example of control is policies or network monitoring to identify unauthorized software.


        Risk is the likelihood and impact of a threat actor exercising a vulnerability.


        Threat is the potential for a threat agent to exercise a vulnerability.
