<h1>Lesson 03: Performing Security Assessments</h1>
    Security assessment - processes and tools that evaluate the attack surface
    
 Lesson Objectives:
   - Assess organizational security with network reconnaissance tools
   - Explain security concerns with general vulnerability types
   - Summarize vulnerability scanning techniques
   - Explain penetration testing concepts

  the 'Cyber Kill Chain' -- 
    - Initial Recon
    - Initial Compromise
    - Establish Foothold
    - Escalate Privileges
    - Internal Recon
    - Complete Mission

  <b>Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain</b>
   1) Reconnaissance
   2) Weaponization
   3) Delivery         - of code to enable exploit
   4) Exploitation
   5) Installation
   6) Command & Control
   7) Action on Objectives

  <b>Hack / Defend Chain</b>
   - Discovery / Recon
   - Penetration / Foothold
   - Process Insertion
   - Persistence
   - Escalate Privileges
   - Internal Reconnaissance
   - Lateral Movement
   - Action on Objectives (data egress, manipulation, APT)
     
  Indicators of Attack (IoA)
  Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
<h2>03A Assess Organizational Security with Network Reconnaissance</h2>   
      Reconnaissance is an assessment activity
       -- maps potential attack surface
       -- identify nodes and connections that make up network

     passive scan == using site such as <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">'shodan.io'</a> or  'whois' or other websites to discover information
     active scan  == using tools ie: Metagoofil; 
               metagoofil downloads html, pdf, txt and other files and then extracts usernames and programs (including version information) that are on the network
                  allows hackers to determine exploits
               nmap == can be used with scripts to obtain more detailed information
                    nmap is a simple network topology scanner
               nmapfe (in zenmap) -- is a GUI frontend for using nmap
<h3>Ipconfig, Ping, and ARP</h3>
     topology scanning aka 'footprinting'
     <b>ipconfig</b> - shows configuration assigned to network interfaces in Windows
                           if the network uses DHCP, it will also point to the DHCP server IP address
     
     <b>ifconfig</b> - show configuration of network interfaces in Linux

     <b>ping</b> - probe a host on a particular IP address using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
          you can use scripting to create loops to increase the use of Ping

     <b>arp</b>  - Address Resolution Protocol (arp) - command can be used to display local machines ARP cache
                the ARP cache shows MAC address of the interfaces associated with each IP address
                  ex: sign of a man in the middle attack is that the MAC address will not match the IP address associated with the router

    ** in linux use 'iproute2' instead of arp, route, and traceroute               
<h3>Route and Traceroute</h3>
     <b>tracert</b>
     <b>traceroute</b>
     <b>pathping</b>

<h3>IP Scanners and Nmap</h3>
     <b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)</b>
     <b>nmap</b>

<h3>Other Reconnaissance and Discovery Tools</h3>
<h3>Packet Capture and TCPdump</h3>
<h3>Packet Analysis and Wireshark</h3>
<h3>Packet Injection and Replay</h3>
<h3>Exploitation Frameworks</h3>
