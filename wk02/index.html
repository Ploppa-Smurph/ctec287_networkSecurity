<h2>03A Assess Organizational Security with Network Reconnaissance</h2>   
      Reconnaissance is an assessment activity
       -- maps potential attack surface
       -- identify nodes and connections that make up network

     passive scan == using site such as <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">'shodan.io'</a> or  'whois' or other websites to discover information
     active scan  == using tools ie: Metagoofil; 
               metagoofil downloads html, pdf, txt and other files and then extracts usernames and programs (including version information) that are on the network
                  allows hackers to determine exploits
               nmap == can be used with scripts to obtain more detailed information
                    nmap is a simple network topology scanner
               nmapfe (in zenmap) -- is a GUI frontend for using nmap
<h3>Ipconfig, Ping, and ARP</h3>
     topology scanning aka 'footprinting'
     <b>ipconfig</b> - shows configuration assigned to network interfaces in Windows
                           if the network uses DHCP, it will also point to the DHCP server IP address
     
     <b>ifconfig</b> - show configuration of network interfaces in Linux

     <b>ping</b> - probe a host on a particular IP address using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
          you can use scripting to create loops to increase the use of Ping

     <b>arp</b>  - Address Resolution Protocol (arp) - command can be used to display local machines ARP cache
                the ARP cache shows MAC address of the interfaces associated with each IP address
                  ex: sign of a man in the middle attack is that the MAC address will not match the IP address associated with the router

    ** in linux use 'iproute2' instead of arp, route, and traceroute               
<h3>Route and Traceroute</h3>
     <b>route</b> - view and configure the host's local routing table

     <b>tracert</b> - uses ICMP probes to report Round Trip Time (RTT) for hops between local and remote host
     
     <b>traceroute</b> - Linux version of the tool, uses UDP probes rather than ICMP
     
     <b>pathping</b> - Windows - provides statistics for latency and packet loss over a longer period
          <b>mtr</b> - Linux version of the tool  
    
       -- high latency at the default gateway compared to the baseline might indicate a man-in-the-middle attack 

     ** in linux use 'iproute2' instead of arp, route, and traceroute
<h3>IP Scanners and Nmap</h3>
     <b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)</b>

     <b>Nmap Security Scanner</b> - popular open source IP scanner
        Nmap pings and sends TCP ACK packet to ports 80 & 443 to determine if a host is present 
<h3>Service Discovery and Nmap</h3>
     after finding the IP addresses and Hosts on a network we discover which OSs are in use on the system, 
         which network service each host is running, and which application software is underpinning those services

     <b>TCP SYN <i>(-sS)</i></b> - fast technique (aka Half-Open Scanning)
                                  the scanning host reqests a connection and then does not acknowledge
                                  the target's response to the scan's SYN packet identifies the port state
                              
     <b>UDP scans <i>(-sU)</i></b> - does not use ACKs - nmap needs to wait and this can take a longer time.
                                   CAN be combined with TCP scan
                                   
     <b>Port Range <i>(-p)</i></b> - by default nmap scans 1000 commonly used ports as listed in configuration file
                                        <i>-p</i> arguement is used to scan specific port ranges                               

     <b>fingerprinting</b> - detailed analysis of services on a particular host 
                 aka 'banner grabbing'

     when sercvices are discovered you can use Nmap with <i>-sV</i> or <i>-A</i> switch to probe a host more intensively
        you can discover: 
          - Protocol - scans and lists what protocols are being used at which port
          - Application Name and Version - ex: Apache Web Server or Windows IIS
          - OS type and Version - use the <i>-o</i> to get the OS,
               (or <i>-A</i> for both OS and version)            
          - Device Type - identifies devices as routers, switches, NAS boxes, printers, webcams, etc..     
<h3>Netstat and Nslookup</h3>
     <b>netstat</b> - shows state of TCP/UDP ports on local machine; can see service misconfigurations
        can alsow be used to identify suspect remote connections to services on local host

        <b><i>netstat -ano</i></b>  -- very helpful when trying to identify malware.
            <i>-a</i> display active TCP and UDP connections, plus open (listening) TCP connections
            <i>-n</i> suppress name resolution, host IP address and ports are shown in output
            <i>-o</i> shows PID (Process ID) of application or service that has port opened

     <b>nslookup / dig</b> - query name records for a given domain
         misconfigured DNS service may allow a 'zone transfer' which will give an attacker complete records of every host in the domain
     
         'nslookup' works for both Windows and Linux; 'dig' is used in Linux
<h3>Other Reconnaissance and Discovery Tools</h3>
    <b>the Harvester</b> - scanns domain or company for public data, including email, names, subdomains, IPs, URLs and more
                    <a href="https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester">link to github 'the Harvester'</a>
    
    <b>dnsenum</b> - packages 'dig', 'whois' and more host identification tools into 1
            ** not updated since 2015 <a href="https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum">link to github 'dnsenum'</a>                     

    <b>scanless</b> - uses 3rd party sites to disguise IP that port scans are coming from
                    <a href="https://github.com/vesche/scanless">link to github 'Scanless'</a>       

    <b>curl</b> - used for performing data transfer and supports many protocols
    
    <b>Nessus</b> - commercial vulnerability scanner, pulls list of services and version information from the host
                     free to use on small home networks, or available as a local (Nessus Manager) or cloud (Tenable Cloud) versions.  
<h3>Packet Capture and TCPdump</h3>
     <b>Packet Analysis</b> - deep frame-by-frame scrutiny of capture frames

     <b>Protocol Analysis</b> - using statistical tools to analyze a sequence of packets 

     <b>tcpdump</b> - command line packet capture tool in Linux. 
               often used with filter expressions to reduce number of frames captured: 
<h3>Packet Analysis and Wireshark</h3>
     <b>traffic analysis</b> - protocol / packet analyzer working with a sniffer to view data flow across network

     <b>wireshark</b> - open-source graphical packet capture and analysis utility 
        various tools are built into wireshare: 
           <b><i>I/O graph</i></b> - 
<h3>Packet Injection and Replay</h3>
       Ettercap, Scapy, and hping

     <b>hping</b> - open source spoofing tool that provides pen tester with ability to craft network packets to exploit vulnerable firewalls and IDSs
          hping performs following tests:
          <i>Host/Port detection and firewall testing</i> - used to probe IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports for responses

          <i>Traceroute</i> - if ICMP is blocked on local network, hping offers alternate way of mapping out network routes

          <i>Denial of Service (DoS)</i> - hping can perform flood-based DoS attacks from randomized source IPs 

     <b>tcpreplay</b> - takes previously captured network traffic (saved as .pcap) and reeplays it through a network interface      
<h3>Exploitation Frameworks</h3>
     <b>Remote Access Trojan (RAT)</b> - malware that give advesary means of remotely accessing network

     <b>expolitation framework</b> - uses vulnerabilities identified by automated scanners and launches scripts to attempt to deliver matching exploits
          <b><i>CVE - Common Vulnerability and Exposure</i></b>
     
     <b>Metasploit</b> - most well known exploit framework, can be used closesly with <b><i>Nexpose</i></b> vulnerability scanner

     <b>Sn1per</b> - framework designed for pentesting and evidence gathering. 
            Sn1per can integrate with Metasploit and Nikto to run autotmated suites of tests

     <b>fireELF</b> - injecting fileless exploit for Linux host

     <b>RouterSploit</b> - vulnerability scanning and exploit modules

     <b>Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)</b> - recovering web session information and exploiting client side script

     <b>Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</b> - scanning tools and scripts for web app and mobile app security testing
     
     <b>Pacu</b> - scanning and exploit tool for AWS (Amazon Web Service)
<h3>Netcat</h3>
     tool used to test network connectivity. netcat can write raw data over a connection

     <b><i>echo "head" | nc 10.1.0.1 -v 80</i></b> this command attempts to connect to the HTTP port (80) and send the banner 'head' keyword

  netcat can be configured as a backdoor:
    - on the victim machine set up a 'listener': 
       <b><i>nc -l -p 666 -e cmd.exe</i></b>

    - the 'listener' grants access when this command is run:
       <b><i>nc 10.1.0.1 666</i></b>  

<h2>03B Explain Security Concerns with General Vulnerability Types</h2>    
<h3>Software Vulnerabilities and Patch Management</h3>
     <b>Operating System (OS)</b> - application exploit that could allow privilege escalation
          ex: 'Dirty COW' can exploit the Linux kernel

     <b>Firmware</b> - vulnerabilities in the BIOS/UEFI that controls boot process, or device firmware bugs.
            Internet of Things (IoT) run OS code as a type of firmware.
          ex: Intel AMT vulnerability
<h3>Zero-Day and Legacy Platform Vulnerabilities</h3>
     <b>Zero-Day</b> - exploit that is exposed before a vendor has a chance to patch it

     <b>Legacy Platfor</b> - older system that is no longer patchable (vendor no longer maintains / updates code)
        must be isolated from the rest of the network in order to secure, because the vendor is no longer patching the software
<h3>Weak Host Configurations</h3>
     <b>Default Settings</b> - deploying a device using only default settings is weak

     <b>Unsecured Root Account</b> - adversaries can gain control of Administrator/Super User acount and wreak havok
            effective user management and authorization policies must be enforced

     <b>Open Permissions</b> - provisioning data without differentiating access rights for user groups. 
<h3>Weak Network Configurations</h3>
    vulnerabiltiy can arise from running unnecessary services or using weak encryption
     <b>Open Ports and Services</b> - running unnecessary services or having open ports increases the 'Attack Surface' of the network
       - restrict endpoint access allowed by service 
       - disable services installed by default, but not needed
       - services that should be available on the private network should have access blocked at ports on the border firewall 

     <b>Unsecure Protocols</b> - unsecured protocols transmit data as 'plaintext'

     <b>Weak Encryption</b> - can allow unauthorized access to data
       - simple passwords can lead to brute-force enumeration, or dictionary enumeration
       - if weak encryption is used then a program can brute-force the enumeration 
       - if the key falls into the hands of an unauthorized user

     <b>Errors</b> - error messages can be revealing and can tell threat actors more about how to exploit the network
<h3>Impacts from Vulnerabilities</h3>
     <b>Data Breaches and Data Exfiltration Impacts</b> - 
          - Data Breach -  event where confidential data is read, transferred, modified, or deleted without authorization.
                can be accidental or intentional

          - Data Exfiltration - ALWAYS Malicious -- data is breached and then transferred to an external network or media
     
     <b>Identity Theft Impacts</b> - privacy breach where threat actor is able to use personal details for fraudulant activity

     <b>Data Loss and Availability Loss Impacts</b> - data becomes unavailable, either permenantly or temporarily
          this affects the Availabilty of the CIA Triad -- can have a severe impact on business work flow

     <b>Financial and Reputation Impacts</b> - breaches cause damage to businesses' reputation and can result in fines, financial damage, and loss of business
<h3>Third-Party Risks</h3>
     <b>Vendor Management</b> - process of selecting supplier and evaluating risks inherent in relying on 3rd-party
               <b><i>System Integration</i></b> - process of using components from multiple vendors to implement a business workflow
                    ex: online store -- contains the store website host, web application firewall, cloud data process and analytics, plu integration with on-premises accounting and customer relationship management (CRM) system

               switching vendors after the workflow has been enacted can be a long and difficult process, because the chain will have to implement the new vendors configuration / application information and the previous vendors information must be removed from the chain     
     <b>Outsourced Code Development</b> - many businesses use 1 team to code an application and then verify security with a different 3rd party team

     <b>Data Storage</b> -  you may need to grant a vendor acccess to data; or may ask a 3rd party vendor to host company data
          - ensure protections for data as if they were stored on-premises (authorization and access management; encryption) 
          - monitor 3rd party access to data storage to ensure compliance
          - evaluate compliance impacts form storing on a 3rd party provider

     <b>Cloud-based vs On-premises Risks</b>
          - on-premises risks: weak configurations, software vulnerabilities
          - cloud-based: operate on shared responsiblity model -- cloud provider is responsible for security of the cloud
               and the client is responsible for security in the cloud

<h2>03C Summarize Vulnerability Scanning Techniques</h2>  
          Automated Vulnerability scanning is key to both initial security assessment and ongoing monitoring.

          keep scanning CVE database up to date in order to be current
<h3>Security Assessments</h3>
     NIST's Technical Guide to Information Testing and Assessment 3 principal activities in assessment: 
      - Test object under assessment ot discover vulnerabilities or to prove effectiveness of security
      - Examine assement object to understand security system and identify any logical weakness
      - Interview personnel to gather information and probe attitudes toward understanding of security 
         
     <b>Vulnerability Assessment</b> - evaluation of system security and ability to meet compliance

     <b>Threat Hunting</b> - 

     <b>Penetration Testing</b> - 
<h3>Vulnerability Scan Types</h3>
     <b>Network Vulnerability Scanner</b> - designed to test network hosts, including PCs, mobile devices, servers, routers, and swithces
          - examines organization's on-premise systems, applications, and devices. Then compares results agains configuration template and known vulnerabilities
               1st scan phase: run detection scan to discover hosts on a particular IP
               2nd phase: a target range of hosts is probed to detect running services, patch level, security configuration and policies, network shares, unused accounts, weak passwords, antivirus config and more...
         
         Network Vulnerability Scanners are configured with a database of known software and configuration vulnerabilities. 

     <b>Application and Web Application Scanner</b> - dedicated scanners configured with more detailed and specific scripts to test for known attacks as well as scan for missing patches and weak configurations. 
          ex: Nikto (web application scanner) -- looks for known web exploits, such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
                may also check source code and database security to detect vulnerabilities

<h3>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</h3>
        CVEs - often described as a vulnerability feed 
          - Nessus tool describes as 'plugins'
          - OpenVAS refers to them as 'Network Vulnerability Tests' (NVTs)
          
     many Network Vulnerability Scanners use the SCAP (Secure Content Automation Protocol) to obtain feed or plug-in updates
     <b>SCAP Secure Content Automation Protocol</b> defines ways to comp[are actual configuration of a system to target-secure baseline
     
     CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) - dictionary of vulnerabilities 
          <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">link to Mitre.org CVE list</a>

       elements of the CVE: 
          - Identifier in format: CVE-YYYY-####
          - Brief description of the vulnerability
          - Reference list of URLs that supply more information about the vulnerability
          - Date vulnerability entry was created
          
     <b>CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System</b> - the ranking system that for vulnerability severity
          a scale of 0 - 10 -- the CVSS is maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams    
<h3>Intrusive vs Non-intrusive Scanning</h3>
     <b>Scan Intrusiveness</b> - measure of how much the scanner interacts with the target

      <b>Active (Intrusive Scanning)</b> - probing a device's configuration using a network conection with the target. 
             active scanning uses more bandwidth. ex: agent-based scanning ??
                expolitation frameworks is highly intrusive and is more involved with 'pen testing' more than automated vulnerability scanning

      <b>Passive (Non-Intrusive Scan)</b> - using readily available information from websites
          <a href="https://zeek.org/">link to the Zeek open-source Network Security Monitoring Tool</a>
<h3>Credentialed vs Non-credentialed Scanning</h3>
       <b>Credentialed Scanning</b> - scan is able to login to the host and has user account rights 
               very in-depth analysis: 
                    - detect application or security setting misconfigurations
                    - demonstrates what an attack on the inside can do 
                    - more intrusive than non-credentialed scan

       <b>Non-credentialed Scan</b> - tests host without having access into the system
               will try routines such as: 
                    - dictionary attack on default device passwords
                    - often used to simulate what an external threat may uncover
<h3>False Positives, False Negatives, and Log Review</h3>
       scanning tools generate summary reports of all vulnerabilities discovered during the scan. 

       false positives: are identified by the scanner as vulnerable, when they are not
         ex: a scan states a known port is targeted by malware, but after researching you see that port is NOT open on the network firewall

       false negatives: potential vulnerabilities that are not identified durint the scan
       
       always make certain to review network logs to stay aware of the network
<h3>Configuration Review</h3>
       generally part of a 'Credentialed scan'
         compares configuration settings on the system with known default or poor configurations

     <b>SCAP Security Content Automation Protocol</b> - allows compatible scanners to determine whether a computer meets the configuration baseline
          - Open Vulnerability and Assesment Language (OVAL) - an XML schema for describing system security state and querying vulnerability reports and information
          
          - Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) - XML schema for developing and audinting best-practice configuration checklists and rules

      compliance scans can be performed - they are necessary for some organizations because of regulatory standards    
<h3>Threat Hunting</h3>
       technique that utilizes insights gained from threat intelligence to proactively discover evidence of TTPs present within a network or system
           <i>Threat Hunting is in contrast to Penetration Testing. Threat Hunting is based on data within the system, while pen testing attempts intrusion as a show of system weakness</i> 
     <b>Advisories and Bulletins</b> - threat hunting is labor intensive and needs to be performend with clear goals

     <b>Intelligence Fusion</b> - organizations with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) keep the analytics platform up to date with TTP and IoC threat data feeds

     <b>Maneuver</b> - when investigating a live threat remember the adversarial nature of of hacking
         maneuvering is taken from the military term and means not giving away your position and trying to out move the attacker
<h2>03D Explain Penetration Testing Concepts</h2>  
          difference between pen tester (red team) & hacking?? jail time 

       3 security auditing areas: 
          - Pen Tester: targets systems, finds specific weaknesses 

          - Red Team: follows up on pen testing, tests an entire enterprise, uses attack model / 'kill chain'

          - Vulnerability Analyst: automated scanning

     Security Auditors search for APTs (Advanced Persistent Treats)
       APT Chain:
         <i>Planning -> Malware Introduction -> Command & Control -> Lateral Movement -> Target Identification -> Exfiltration (Attack Event) -> Retreat</i>

     many times APTs are operating in a network for an extended period and gathering data until they deploy their load   
     
   <b>CYBER KILL CHAIN Steps and Teamwork</b>
     <i>Step</i>                                  <i>Pen Tester</i>                                    <i>Security Analyst</i> 
   <b>Reconnaissance</b>         <b><i>Attack Pattern, threat landsapes, scans</i></b>     <b><i>Social Engineering detection, Traffic identification</i></b>
   <b>Weaponization</b>          <b><i>Coupling Remote Access with an Exploit</i></b>      <b><i>Noticing 'cracks' between systems. Knowing business value of system</i></b>
   <b>Delivery</b>               <b><i>Transmission of weapon. Software install</i></b>    <b><i>Application being installed. Monitoring of processes. End user complaints</i></b>
   <b>Exploitation</b>           <b><i>Triggering the code to conduct the exploit</i></b>  <b><i>Alerts, either by end users or software of security professionals</i></b>
   <b>Installation</b>           <b><i>Code runs persistently</i></b>                      <b><i>Identifying application behavior. Look for new application on system</i></b>
   <b>Command & Control</b>      <b><i>Traffic dedicated to managing installed code</i></b><b><i>System behaving abnormally, slowdowns</i></b>
   <b>Actions on Objective</b>   <b><i>Involves exfiltration of data</i></b>               <b><i>Files deleted or added. New Software. Newly opened ports</i></b>

  pen testing will have a stated agreement. These are contracts that are signed, otherwise you are hacking

  Logical vs Physical pen testing
     - physical - can you get into a building, can you get into a secure area?
     - logical  - penetrating network, trying to get into systems that you are not authenticated for

     - 'white box' audit - you will have limited or full documentation of the system
     - 'black box' audit - have no idea what system you are trying to penetrate  
<h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
     Pen Testing - use of authorized hacking techniques to discover and exploit weaknesses in a target system 
       (aka Ethical Hacking) 
      - <b>Verify Threat Exists</b> - use surveillance, social engineering, network scanners, and vulnerability assement tools to identify a vector by which vulnerabilities can be exploited
      
      - <b>Bypass Security Controls</b> - look for ways to attack the system, logical or physical

      - <b>Actively Test Security Controls</b> - probe controls for configuration weaknesses and errors, such as weak passwords or software vulnerabilities

      - <b>Exploit Vulnerabilities</b> - prove the vulnerability is a high risk by exploiting it to gain access to data or install backdoors

     a passive vulnerability assessment may discover an unpatched SQL server 
       pen testing is a highly invasive active scan that will tyr to expolit the vulnerability to 'pwn' the server 
<h3>Rules of Engagement</h3>
     the Rules of Engagement is what seperates a pen tester from a hacker

     <b>Attack Profile</b>
          - Black Box: no privileges and may not know anything about the network and security
                requires a reconnaissance phase; useful to simulate behavior of external threat

          - White Box: known environment; given privileges to system and has access.
                tester skips reconaissance phase; simulate behavior of privileged inside threat

          - Gray Box: partially known environment

     <b>Bug Bounty</b> - vendor offers rewards for reporting vulnerabilities 
<h3>Exercise Types</h3>
     <b>Red Team</b>    - offensive role; infiltrate the target

     <b>Blue Team</b>   - defensive role; monitors alerts and controls to detect and prevent infiltration

     <b>White Team</b>  - sets rules of engagement

     <b>Purple Team</b> - red and blue team meet during the exercise and give each other updates 
<h3>Passive and Active Reconnaissance</h3>
     black box testing starts with a reconaissance phase
      - Active Reconaissance - can alert target that someone is querying their network and probing their ports
      - Passive Reconaissance - is not intrusive, use outside sources to gather intelligence

     <b>OSINT Open Source Intelligence</b> - web searches, social media, and sites that scan of vulnerabilities in internet connencted devices
     
     <b>Social Engineering</b> - obtaining information, access to premesis, or access to user account through persuasion

     <b>Footprinting</b> - software tools (ex: nmap) to obtain information about a host or network topology.
                           Most forms of footprinting are active scanning; an example of passive footprinting is packet sniffing
          
     <b>War Driving</b> - mapping the location and type of wireless networks operated by the target. 
                 attacker might position a rouge access point device (ex: Hak5 Pineapple)

     <b>Drones/UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)</b> - testers reconnoiter premises and perform war driving from the air 
                 drones have also been used to drop USB drives as a form of social engineering

<h2>Lesson 03: Quiz</h2>
<b>An IT director reads about a new form of malware that targets a system widely utilized in the company’s network. The director wants to discover whether the network has been targeted, but also wants to conduct the scan without disrupting company operations or tipping off potential attackers to the investigation. 
     Evaluate vulnerability scanning techniques and determine the best option for the investigation.</b>
  <i>Threat Hunting is based on analysis of data within a system and is much less disruptive than pentesting</i>

<b>Compare and contrast vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Select the true statement from the following options.</b>  
  <i>Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can use passive or active reconnaissance techniques. A passive approach tries to discover issues without causing an impact to systems, whereas an active approach may cause instability on a scanned system.</i>

<b>A network administrator uses an automated vulnerability scanner. It regularly updates with the latest vulnerability feeds.  If the system regularly performs active scans and returns the presence of vulnerabilities when they do not exist, 
      what type of error is the system most likely making?</b>  
  <i>A false positive is something that is identified by a scanner or other assessment tool as being a vulnerability, when in fact it is not.</i>    

<b>15.0% complete
     Question
     Which statement best explains the differences between black box, white box, and gray box attack profiles used in penetration testing?</b>  
  <i>A black box penetration tester receives no privileged information, while a white box tester has complete access. A white box test may follow up on a black box test.</i>    

<b>Analyze and eliminate the item that is NOT an example of a reconnaissance technique.</b>
  <i>Initial Exploitation</i> from the options (OSINT - Open Source Intelligence, Social Engineering, Scanning)   

<b>A network manager needs a map of the network's topology. The network manager is using Network Mapper (Nmap) and will obtain the visual map with the Zenmap tool. If the target IP address is 192.168.1.1, 
      determine the command within Nmap that will return the necessary data to build the visual map of the network topology.</b>  
  <i>nmap -sn --traceroute 192.168.1.1</i>

<b>In which of these situations might a non-credentialed vulnerability scan be more advantageous than a credentialed scan?</b>  
  <i>Non-credentialed scanning is often the most appropriate technique for external assessment of the network perimeter or when performing web application scanning.

     A non-credentialed scan proceeds by directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. A non-credentialed scan provides a view of what the host exposes to an unprivileged user on the network.</i>

<b>A system administrator must scan the company’s web-based application to identify which ports are open and which OS/CPE can be seen from the outside world. Determine the syntax that should be used to yield the 
     desired information if the administrator will be executing this task from a Linux command line.</b>     
  <i>The correct syntax is nmap -O. When the -O switch is used with nmap, it displays open ports and the installed operating system, but does not show the version</i>   

<b>An outside security consultant updates a company’s network, including data cloud storage solutions. The consultant leaves the manufacturer’s default settings when installing network switches, assuming the vendor shipped the switches 
     in a default-secure configuration. Examine the company’s network security posture and select the statements that describe key vulnerabilities in this network.</b>  
  <i>Default configurations in devices, whether they come from vendors in a secure state or not, may not cater to specific organizational needs. Such configurations might have unnecessary services running or might not be optimized for a particular business environment.

     Relying on the manufacturer default settings when deploying an appliance or software applications is a weak configuration. Although many vendors ship products in secure default configurations, it is insufficient to rely on default settings.
     
     Default settings may leave unsecure interfaces enabled that allow an attacker to compromise the device. Weak settings on network appliances can allow attackers to move through the network unhindered and snoop on traffic.</i>

<b>Following a data breach at a large retail company, their public relations team issues a statement emphasizing the company’s commitment to consumer privacy. Identify the true statements concerning this event. </b>     
  <i>A privacy breach may allow the threat actor to perform identity theft or to sell the data to other malicious actors. Malicious actors may obtain account credentials or use personal details and financial information to make fraudulent credit applications and purchases.


     A data breach can cause a data exfiltration event to occur. A data exfiltration event is always intentional and malicious.
     
     
     A data breach event is where confidential data is read or transferred without authorization. A data breach, unlike data exfiltration, can be intentional/malicious or unintentional/accidental.</i>
  
<b>Identify the command that can be used to detect the presence of a host on a particular IP address.</b>
  <i>The ping command can be used to detect the presence of a host on a particular IP address or that responds to a particular host name. This command is a fast and easy way to determine if a system can communicate over the network with another system.</i>  

<b>A hacker sets up a C2 network to control a compromised host. What refers to the hacker’s ability to reconnect to the compromised host and use it as a RAT or backdoor?</b>  
  <i>Persistence refers to the hacker’s ability to reconnect to the compromised host and use it as a Remote Access Tool (RAT) or backdoor. To do this, the hacker must establish a Command and Control (C2 or C&C) network.</i>

<b>Which of the following statements summarizes a disadvantage to performing an active vulnerability scan?</b>
  <i>Scan intrusiveness is a measure of how much the scanner interacts with the target. Active scanning consumes more network bandwidth than passive scanning.

     Active scanning means probing the device's configuration using some type of network connection with the target. This type of scanning runs the risk of crashing the target of the scan or causing some other sort of outage.</i>  

<b>During a penetration test, systems administrators for a large company are tasked to play on the white team for an affiliated company. Examine each of the following roles and determine which role the systems admins will fill.</b>
  <i>A white team sets the rules of engagement and monitors the exercise, providing arbitration and guidance, and if necessary, halt the exercise. If the red team is third party, the white team will include a representative of the consultancy company.</i>  

<b>Select the statement which best describes the difference between a zero-day vulnerability and a legacy platform vulnerability.</b>
  <i>A zero-day vulnerability is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch. These can be extremely destructive, as it can take the vendor some time to develop a patch, leaving systems vulnerable in the interim.

     A legacy platform is no longer supported with security patches by its developer or vendor. By definition, legacy platforms are not patchable.</i>  

<b>A manufacturing company hires a pentesting firm to uncover any vulnerabilities in their network with the understanding that the pen tester receives no information about the company’s system. 
     Which of the following penetration testing strategies is the manufacturing company requesting?</b>
  <i>Black box (or blind) is when the pen tester receives no privileged information about the network and its security systems. Black box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of an external threat.</i>  

<b>Select the appropriate methods for packet capture.</b>
  <i>Wireshark and tcpdump are packet sniffers. A sniffer is a tool that captures packets, or frames, moving over a network.

     Wireshark is an open source graphical packet capture and analysis utility. Wireshark works with most operating systems, where tcpdump is a command line packet capture utility for Linux.</i>  

<b>Encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to protected data. Which component is subject to brute-force enumeration?</b>
  <i>Weak encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data. An algorithm or cipher used for encryption has known weaknesses that allow brute-force enumeration.</i>  

<b>A contractor has been hired to conduct penetration testing on a company's network. They have decided to try to crack the passwords on a percentage of systems within the company. 
     They plan to annotate the type of data that is on the systems that they can successfully crack to prove the ease of access to data. Evaluate the penetration steps and determine which are being utilized for this task.</b>
  <i>Test Security Controls; Exploit Vulnerabilities</i>  

<b>As the result of a recent breach, a cyber technician is tasked with reviewing various attack vectors associated with escalation of privileges. Which of the following vector escalation vulnerabilities can be 
     associated with an OS kernel file or shared library allowing malware code to run with higher access rights?</b>
  <i>A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library can allow privilege escalation, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Root or system accounts are considered superuser accounts with administrative privileges.</i>
